<h2 id="history-of-japanese-rice-trader">HISTORY OF JAPANESE RICE TRADER</h2>

<p>Technical analysis actually has some solid science behind it, and has existed for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>The candlestick chart, that comes to mind, when thinking of trading, is said to have been invented by a japanese rice merchant named <em>Honma Monehisa</em> almost 300 years ago.</p>

<p>Honma wrote what is believed to be the first book on <em>market psychology</em>, which details many of the patterns and terminologies expert traders continue to use to this day.</p>

<p>He’s believed to be the most successful trader, who ever lived, reportedly banging over 10 billion in today’s dollars over the course of his trading career.</p>

<p>That’s not so hard to believe, considering that he was probably the only person on the planet at the time, who had an in-depth understanding of the ebb and flow of commodity markets.</p>

<h2 id="human-psychology-is-the-critical-factor">HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY IS THE CRITICAL FACTOR</h2>

<p>But it wasn’t just Honma’s first mover status, that made his trading so successful.</p>

<p>It was his understanding, that human psychology is what fundamentally moves any given market.</p>

<p>Emotions like <strong>fear and greed</strong> follow surprisingly consistent patterns, and with the right analysis, these patterns can not only be easily seen on a candlestick chart, they can also be predicted.</p>

<h2 id="other-factors-worth-keeping-in-mind">OTHER FACTORS WORTH KEEPING IN MIND</h2>

<p>Although technical analysis has proven itself to be a powerful trading tool, there are other factors one should keep in mind, when it comes to crafting a trading strategy for cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>This includes things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tokenomics,</li>
  <li>network activity,</li>
  <li>use case,</li>
  <li>the team behind the cryptocurrency,</li>
  <li>any notable partnerships it has,</li>
  <li>and even macro indicators, like Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow model, and Bitcoin dominance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Evaluating these factors is called <strong>fundamental analysis</strong>, because it focuses on more objective measures of an asset’s potential value.</p>

<h2 id="fundamental-analysis-vs-technical-analysis">FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS VS TECHNICAL ANALYSIS</h2>

<p>In contrast to fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses almost exclusively on price action.</p>

<p>Pumps and dumps are ultimately caused by the irrational emotions of the people holding an asset, fundamentals be damned.</p>

<p>Some would argue, that technical analysis is the more accurate way to trade cryptocurrencies, given that the average cryptocurrency holder is exponentially more irrational, than the Wall Street investors.</p>

<p>However, each cryptocurrency will require its own special blend of fundamental analysis and technical analysis in its price projections.</p>

<p>It will be up to <em>you</em> to figure out, how much emphasis you should be putting on one versus the other.</p>

<p>Most of this will be determined by how long you plan to hold that cryptocurrency for.</p>

<p><strong>As a rule of thumb, technical analysis is used for shorter term trading, and fundamental analysis is used for longer term trading and hodling.</strong></p>

<h2 id="trading-pairs-as-an-indicatpr-of-performance">TRADING PAIRS AS AN INDICATPR OF PERFORMANCE</h2>

<p>It’s worth remembering that although stablecoin trading pairs, like ETH-USDT are the easiest to keep track of an asset, in terms of dollar value, trading pairs with Bitcoin, such as ETH-BTC can often a better sense of how well a cryptocurrency is performing relative to others.</p>

<p>This is obviously pertaining to altcoins.</p>

<h2 id="candles">CANDLES</h2>

<p>Almost everything in technical analysis involves the candlestick chart.</p>

<p>When it comes to trading, each candle you see on that graph, in a standard cryptocurrency exchange gives you a snapshot of the trading activity within a given unit of time.</p>

<p>For example, if you have the chart set for one hour, each candle will represent one hour of trading activity for that asset pair.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, a green candle mean prices went up during that period, and a red candle means that prices went down.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/1.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Almost all the candles will have something called a <strong>body</strong> and a <strong>wick</strong>.</p>

<p>The body is the thicker part of the candle, and the wick are those lines poking from the top or the bottom.</p>

<p>For green candles, the bottom of the body is the price, that the trading started at, during the time period, and for red candles it’s the top of the body.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/2.PNG" />
</center>

<p>When you see a candle, as above, it means, that almost all of the trading during that time period took place within a very narrow price range.</p>

<p>This means that the price did not change during that time.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/3.PNG" />
</center>

<p>When you see a candle that’s almost all body with no wicks, that means price either moved to the upside or to the downside during that period.</p>

<p>The bigger these candles are the more fomo or fud investors feel.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/4.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Wicks on a candle denote the highest and lowest trading prices during that time frame.</p>

<p>These wicks are incredibly useful, because they can tell, when traders are taking profits or buying the dip.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/5.PNG" />
</center>

<p>A long wick on the bottom of a candle suggests, that traders are buying the dip, meaning price could still be bullish.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/6.PNG" />
</center>

<p>A long wick at the top of a candle suggests, that traders are itching to take profits, which could be foreshadowing a shakeout.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/7.PNG" />
</center>

<p>However, it’s only when you factor in trading volume, that you can really start making price predictions with candlestick charts.</p>

<h3 id="trading-volume">TRADING VOLUME</h3>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/8.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Factoring in trading volume is critical for good technical analysis.</p>

<p>Each volume bar you see at the bottom of a trading window, shows you <strong>the amount of an asset, that was traded during the time frame you’ve set</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/9.PNG" />
</center>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, you want to be trading on a market with lots of volume.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/10.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Low volume tends to lead to price volatility, meaning that price could suddenly spike up or down.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/11.PNG" />
</center>

<p><strong>Pro tip: volume is the first thing you should look at, when you’re considering buying some hot altcoin.</strong></p>

<p>On a shady cryptocurrency exchange some lesser-known exchanges will even set longer default trading time periods to hide low liquidity and questionable price action.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/12.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Make sure that you still see a high amount of trading volume with shorter time frames, before throwing your money into the void.</p>

<h4 id="price-trend-due-to-volume">PRICE TREND DUE TO VOLUME</h4>

<p>Volume is used by many traders to confirm a price trend.</p>

<p>For example, imagine you see the price of your favorite altcoin steadily dropping most of the candlesticks in the last few hours or days.</p>

<p>Have been read and it’s not getting any better.</p>

<p>Without looking at the volume, you might think this means you’re headed for some hurt.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/13.PNG" />
</center>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/14.PNG" />
</center>

<p>But when you check the volume, and you see that as price continues to drop, trading volume is also dropping.</p>

<p>This means that the downtrend you see is not very strong, despite what the price action might have.</p>

<p>You believe the bulls are standing by, and once the volume drops low enough, volatility kicks back in and the bulls are off to the races.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/15.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The same is true, if the price is rising and trading volume is decreasing.</p>

<p>This means that there’s only a matter of time, before volatility strikes, and that could bring a strong reversal in price action.</p>

<h2 id="common-patterns-found-in-trading">COMMON PATTERNS FOUND IN TRADING</h2>

<p>Now, that you have a solid grasp of candlesticks and trading volume, let’s take a closer look at some of the common patterns found in trading.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever seen an expert trader in action, you know they love to draw lines as much as the fed loves to print money.</p>

<p>When traders draw lines, they’re normally looking for three things.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Support</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Resistance</strong></li>
  <li><strong>and a Recognizable Price Pattern</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="support">SUPPORT</h2>

<p>Support refers to the lower limit of where the price of an asset could go.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/16.PNG" />
</center>

<h5 id="resistance">RESISTANCE</h5>

<p>Resistance refers to the upper limit of where the price of an asset could go.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/17.PNG" />
</center>

<p>There are many ways to assess, where the support and resistant prices could be.</p>

<p>The simplest method is to look at the lowest and highest prices hit during a given time period.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/18.PNG" />
</center>

<p>If you draw a resistance line across the tops, and a support line across the bottoms, it will give you a sense, of how much volatility the market could experience.</p>

<p>Going forward, which direction the price is likely moving, and even when to sell and when to buy.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/19.PNG" />
</center>

<p>More often than not drawing these support and resistance lines reveals a recognizable price pattern.</p>

<p>There are dozens of price patterns, and most of these have stood the test of time continuing to repeat themselves in every market.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/20.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Ever since Honma Munihisa first defined, them almost 300 years ago, of all these patterns <strong>triangle patterns</strong> are considered to be the most reliable by professional traders.</p>

<p><strong>Triangle is created every time support and resistant lines converge.</strong></p>

<p>The two most common triangle patterns are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ascending triangles, and</strong></li>
  <li><strong>descending triangles</strong></li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/21.PNG" />
</center>

<p>In an <strong>ascending triangle</strong>, the resistance line is more or less flat, and the support line is angled upwards.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/22.PNG" />
</center>

<p>In a <strong>descending triangle</strong> the resistance line is angled downwards and the support line is flat.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/23.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Why the hell are these triangles so important?</p>

<p>Well, when the current price reaches the edge of an ascending triangle, price tends to spike upwards, and when it reaches the edge of a descending triangle, the price tends to drop.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/24.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Oddly enough, you can often use the left side of the triangle to determine, just how much the price will change to the upside or to the downside.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/25.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="techncial-indicators">TECHNCIAL INDICATORS</h2>

<p>If this feels a bit too arbitrary, you can use a number of technical indicators to help you double check, if you’re on the right track.</p>

<p>With your support and resistance lines, there are literally hundreds of different indicators, that people use in technical analysis trading.</p>

<p>Some of these are free to use, and others you will have to pay for.</p>

<p>Unless you’re planning on being the next wolf of wall street, free technical indicators will be more than enough to build a robust trading strategy.</p>

<p>There are 4 technical indicators, that you should know if you want to effectively trade cryptocurrency:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moving Averages,</li>
  <li>the MACD,</li>
  <li>the RSI, and</li>
  <li>Bollinger Bands.</li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/26.PNG" />
</center>

<h4 id="emas">EMAs</h4>

<p>Moving Average indicators draw the average price of an asset over a given period of time.</p>

<p>Exponential Moving Averages, or EMAs are commonly used in technical analysis trading.</p>

<p>Without getting into the details, EMAs put more weight on more recent prices when projecting a trend, and react faster to price changes.</p>

<p>Many traders believe EMAs to be the most useful Moving Average indicators.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/27.PNG" />
</center>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/28.PNG" />
</center>

<p>For this reason, EMAs, especially the 200-day EMA, are considered to be very important price zones for many traders.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/29.PNG" />
</center>

<p>If the current price of a cryptocurrency is below its 200-day EMA, then it might see some resistance, when it hits the 200-day EMA line.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/30.PNG" />
</center>

<p>In contrast, if the price of a cryptocurrency is above its 200-day EMA, the 200-day EMA line is often considered to be a strong zone of price support.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/31.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The reasoning here is that, the market has basically agreed that the fair price for that cryptocurrency is somewhere within that range, as evidenced by the aggregated price action.</p>

<p>When a short-term Moving Average, such as the 20-day EMA crosses the 200-day Moving Average from above, this is called a <strong>death cross</strong> and signals to traders, that we’re headed for a downturn in that market.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/32.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Bitcoin experienced a death cross just over a week before the flash crash in March, where it dropped by 60% in price.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/33.PNG" />
</center>

<p>When a shorter term Moving Average, such as the 20-day EMA crosses the 200-day Moving Average from below, this is called a <strong>golden cross</strong> and signals that there are many green days ahead for that market.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/34.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Bitcoin experienced the golden cross in May.</p>

<p>Its price jumped from 8000 to 10000 shortly afterwards, and has been in an uptrend ever since.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/35.PNG" />
</center>

<h3 id="macd">MACD</h3>

<p>There is another powerful technical indicator, based on Moving Averages called the MACD.</p>

<p><strong>MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence.</strong></p>

<p>It’s used to determine new trends in price and measure price volatility.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/36.PNG" />
</center>

<p>For the purposes of this video, all I’ll say about the MACD is that, <strong>when the two lines you see are far apart it means, that price volatility is low.</strong></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/37.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The closer those lines are together, the higher the volatility.</p>

<p>If those two lines cross this indicates, that the price is going to change direction, in the coming hours or days, and the direction of the bars, you see, will tell you which way the price is likely to go.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/38.PNG" />
</center>

<h3 id="rsi">RSI</h3>

<p>Now, for my personal favorite, the RSI short for Relative Strength Index.</p>

<p>The RSI is a favorite among cryptocurrency traders.</p>

<p><strong>This is because it tells you if a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued.</strong></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/39.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The RSI indicator is drawn within a number range of naught to 100.</p>

<p>You can see this on the right hand side of the RSI’s indicator window.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/40.PNG" />
</center>

<p><strong>If the current position of the indicator is below 30, this means that the cryptocurrency you’re looking at is probably undervalued.</strong></p>

<p>In other words, it’s time to <strong>buy</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/41.PNG" />
</center>

<p><strong>However, if the indicator is positioned over 70, the crypto you’re looking at is entering bubble territory.</strong></p>

<p>It’s time to <strong>sell</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/42.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The trend of the RSI line will give you a sense of whether the cryptocurrency, you’re looking at, is becoming overvalued or undervalued as time goes on.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/43.PNG" />
</center>

<p>As long, as you’re within the 30 to 70 range, the price is right.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/44.PNG" />
</center>

<h3 id="bollinger-band-indicator">BOLLINGER BAND INDICATOR</h3>

<p>Finally, the Bollinger Band indicator.</p>

<p>Like the MACD, the Bollinger Band indicator is used to measure market volatility.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/45.PNG" />
</center>

<p>In contrast to the MACD, the wider the lines are on the bollinger band indicator, the more volatility there is.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/46.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Traders, who use the Bollinger Band will generally buy, when there is low volatility, and sell, when there is high volatility, assuming price has gone to the upside during that volatile period.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/47.PNG" />
</center>

<p>If you slap the Bollinger Band indicator on your favorite crypto, and see that its price is outside of the indicators range, its high time to buy or sell, depending on whether the price is pushing beneath or piercing through the top of the indicator’s range.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/48.PNG" />
</center>

<h4 id="technical-indicators---conclusion">TECHNICAL INDICATORS - CONCLUSION</h4>

<p>Using the various EMAs, the MACD, the RSI, and the Bollinger Band in tandem, should give you all the information you need, to execute effective short-term trades on your favorite cryptos.</p>

<p>Just remember that what you see, can, and probably will, change the second you adjust the time frame, so are you ready to go out and sell those tops and buy those dips?</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/49.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>It’s going to take lots of time, lots of practice, and lots of patience to build a solid trading strategy.</p>

<p>So, to sum up:</p>

<p><strong>Candlestick charts show you much more than basic price action.</strong></p>

<p>They can show things like, whether people are buying the dip or taking profits.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing trend lines on candlestick charts reveals patterns that have repeated themselves in the markets for hundreds of years.</strong></p>

<p>These will help give you a sense of where the price might be heading.</p>

<p><strong>Taking note of the trading volume will confirm whether that price action is genuine or not.</strong></p>

<p>Moving Averages, the MACD, the RSI, and the Bollinger Band will help <strong>add some perspective to your initial calculations, by giving a more accurate picture of price volatility, identify any possible bubbles, or buying opportunities, and warn you of any incoming crashes or moonshots.</strong></p>

<p>It’s for best to double check the time frames you’re working with, and remember, that you’ll probably have to use slightly different trading strategies for different cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>It’s also important to remember, that technical indicators are not the be-all and end-all of cryptocurrency trading, and keeping the fundamentals in mind will go a long way, to helping make sure you see more green, than red over the long term.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more to cryptocurrency trading however - Sentiment analysis, whale movements, fibonacci retracements, etc.</p>
