<h2 id="international-transactions">INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS</h2>

<p>Ripple and XRP are one of the leading cryptocurrencies around.</p>

<p>Have you ever had occasion where you needed to wire money to someone only to be told it might take several days for that money to appear in their account?</p>

<p>That’s because most major banks are still using systems that were built 40 years ago for this task.</p>

<p>Swift, MoneyGram and Western Union are just some examples of slow, expensive  and relatively limited systems that financial services use  to transfer money.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/0.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="transaction-going-through-intermediary-banks">TRANSACTION GOING THROUGH INTERMEDIARY BANKS</h2>

<p>On top of that, not all of the banks are connected  via the same network.</p>

<p>So, in many cases, you don’t even have a direct line between two banks when they need to transfer money from one account to the other.</p>

<p>In order for bank A to send money to bank B that it doesn’t have any direct relationship with, more often than not it will have to go through several intermediary banks, searching for common network connections between each other in order to clear a path for the money.</p>

<p>That’s why international wire transfers are so slow and costly.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/1.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="money-conversations">MONEY CONVERSATIONS</h2>
<p>Each bank along the way takes time to process the transaction and a fee for servicing the process.</p>

<p>In some cases, bank transfers must involve currency conversions, which make things  even more problematic and expensive.</p>

<p>For example, directly transferring currency from Japan to Nicaragua, means turning Yens into Cordobas, which is generally not feasible.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/2.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The reason is that Japanese banks don’t usually hold accounts denominated in Cordobas because there’s not a lot of demand for them.</p>

<p>However, both Japanese and Nicaraguan banks hold accounts in dollars.</p>

<p>So instead, an individual or bank will usually trade Yens for Dollars and then Dollars to Cordobas.</p>

<p>As one can imagine, this process can be costly due to the multiple conversions.</p>

<h2 id="ripple-for-banks-to-transfer-cash-around-the-world">RIPPLE FOR BANKS TO TRANSFER CASH AROUND THE WORLD</h2>

<p>In short, the banking system today doesn’t have a main connecting network  with a uniform set of rules.</p>

<p>Each time you want to exchange  or send money through the banking system, you need to find a path to transfer that money, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what Ripple is here to change.</p>

<p>Just like the Internet has its own rules, or protocol, to transfer information known as HTTP, RippleNet uses a protocol known as <strong>RTXP</strong>, for moving value around the world.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/3.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="ripplenet">RIPPLENET</h2>

<p>Ripple Labs, the creators of RippleNet, aim to create the “Internet of Value” - a way for money to move as quickly as information does.</p>

<p>Through the use of RippleNet, there is no reason to pay a fortune and wait days when transferring money globally.</p>

<p>The idea for Ripple was actually first conceived way back in 2004 by Ryan Fugger and was called RipplePay, but in 2012 was passed to Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen who founded OpenCoin later to be called Ripple Labs.</p>

<p>Unlike most cryptocurrencie,s who focus on the individual, <strong>Ripple Labs aims to serve banks and payment providers, allowing them to lower transaction costs  and expedite settlements.</strong></p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work-validators-gateways">HOW DOES IT WORK? VALIDATORS, GATEWAYS</h2>

<p><strong>RippleNet is a network based on a set of rules known as the Ripple Transaction Protocol or RTXP for short.</strong></p>

<p>The network consists of computers, known as validators, that are spread around the world and maintain a shared ledger of who owns what.</p>

<p>Validators make sure every transaction sent through the network follows the RTXP rules.</p>

<p>Anyone can run a validator and help maintain the Ripple network just like anyone can run a Bitcoin node to maintain the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Companies who want to access the Ripple network can use gateways.</p>

<p><strong>Gateways, which are usually run by banks, act as entry points to Ripple for people outside the network.</strong></p>

<p>It’s the same idea as going to a bank or a credit company to gain access to the banking system.</p>

<p><strong>So Ripple basically offers businesses an alternative to the banking system in the form of an Internet of value called RippleNet.</strong></p>

<h2 id="our-money-can-be-on-xrp-and-we-might-not-know">OUR MONEY CAN BE ON XRP AND WE MIGHT NOT KNOW</h2>

<p>Ripple products like <strong>xRapid</strong>, <strong>xVia</strong> and <strong>xCurrent</strong> are offered to companies in order to optimize their current solutions for transfering money around the world.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/5.PNG" />
</center>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that for you, as a customer of a financial service  using Ripple, this solution is transparent.</p>

<p>If the bank switches to this technology, your bank account balance  could be residing on the XRP ledger tomorrow and you would never know it.</p>

<h2 id="two-types-of-currency">TWO TYPES OF CURRENCY</h2>

<p>This all sounds great, but what type of currency  can actually be sent through the Ripple Network?</p>

<p>Unlike other cryptocurrency protocols, which support only their own asset, Ripple offers two different types of currencies: IOUs and XRP.</p>

<h2 id="iou">IOU</h2>

<p>IOUs are tokens on the Ripple network  that can be stored on any Ripple wallet.</p>

<p>Just like we can store a variety of Ethereum tokens on an Ethereum wallet, we can have plenty of tokens coexisting on the same Ripple wallet.</p>

<p>But we really should stop the comparison here, since this is as far as the similarities go.</p>

<p>Any participant on the Ripple network can issue an IOU, however an IOU doesn’t represent something you OWN.</p>

<p>It represents something you OWE.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/7.PNG" />
</center>

<p>It’s a debt, an obligation to pay back something you got in real life.</p>

<p>When I issue an IOU to someone, it means I owe them something.</p>

<p>When I hold an IOU issued by someone else, it means someone owes me something.</p>

<p>Each IOU has a name that is comprised out of who issued it and what it represents.</p>

<p>For example, USD.Bitstamp is an IOU issued by Bitstamp promising to pay back USD dollars.</p>

<p>An IOU can be issued for any type of real world asset.</p>

<p>For example you can have an IOU for dollars, EUROs, gold, oil, airline miles and even cows.</p>

<p>For each asset we borrow, we will issue a new IOU.</p>

<p>Unlike other forms of debt that can be traded, IOUs for the same asset type  are not interchangeable if they were issued by two different people.</p>

<p>For example, if I borrow money from you and issue you a 20 USD.Nate IOU, that IOU can’t be added to a 20 USD.Bitstamp IOU.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/8.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="depends-on-trust">DEPENDS ON TRUST</h2>

<p>Since each IOU has a different credit line or trust line, you can only redeem  the USD.Nate IOU from me.</p>

<p><strong>It’s important to note that  the IOU itself is not the asset, it’s just a promise by the issuer  to give you the asset back in the future.</strong></p>

<p>This promise won’t do you any good, if the issuer isn’t good for his word.</p>

<p>That’s why trust plays an important issue with IOUs.</p>

<p>In order for you to accept an IOU from someone, you have to trust that they will be able to pay you back.</p>

<p>In RippleNet this is known as a <strong>trust line</strong>.</p>

<p>A trust line is somewhat similar to a line of credit with the bank.</p>

<p><strong>It’s an agreement to trust someone up to a limited amount of money.</strong></p>

<h2 id="xrp">XRP</h2>

<p>Aside from IOUs there is another currency the Ripple protocol supports - XRP.</p>

<p>XRP is a currency issued by Ripple Labs to help transfer payments through the Ripple Network.</p>

<p>For example, if a bank wants to move large amounts of money, instead of needing to use  multiple intermediary banks to transfer the money, it can just convert the money to XRP and send that XRP to the recipient bank.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that two banks don’t have to use XRP to transfer assets between them.</p>

<p>Instead, they can choose to keep  an ‘open tab’ using IOUs only, without ever closing it.</p>

<h2 id="tradable-asset-and-no-trust-needed">TRADABLE ASSET AND NO TRUST NEEDED</h2>

<p>Still, XRP is a form of payment that unlike an IOU is final and is considered a tradable asset by anyone on the network.</p>

<p>Unlike IOUs, XRP is the actual asset so there is no counterparty risk.</p>

<p>In other words, once you’ve received payment in XRP, the transaction is made and there’s no fear that the other party will not meet its obligations for payment.</p>

<h2 id="if-xrp-is-so-cool-why-iou">IF XRP IS SO COOL, WHY IOU?</h2>

<p>So, if no trust is needed and no trust line needs to be opened when sending XRP to other network participants, why do we even need IOU?</p>

<p>The simple answer is that <strong>XRP, being a cryptocurrency asset by itself, is relatively volatile and also not respected worldwide.</strong></p>

<p>IOUs, on the other hand, are treated and valued as the assets each represent.</p>

<h2 id="more-pros-of-xrp">MORE PROS OF XRP</h2>

<p>XRP has additional advantages as well.</p>

<p>It’s fast and scalable.</p>

<p>Sending an XRP transaction through the network takes 4 seconds as opposed to Bitcoin’s 10 minute average.</p>

<p>Also, XRP can handle 1,500 transactions per second, while Bitcoin can handle only 7.</p>

<p>So the upside of using XRP as a form of payment is pretty obvious.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/9.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="can-xrp-be-mined">CAN XRP BE MINED?</h2>

<p>So, if XRP is a cryptocurrency, can it be mined?</p>

<p>The answer is - <strong>no, it can’t.</strong></p>

<p>Mining in Bitcoin is done in order to confirm and determine the order of transactions on the blockchain.</p>

<p>In Ripple transactions are handled through a different process.</p>

<h2 id="validators-rules-the-blockchain">VALIDATORS RULES THE BLOCKCHAIN</h2>

<p>When an XRP transaction is broadcast through the network, the validators that maintain the network decide if it’s valid or not through <strong>voting</strong>.</p>

<p>When a validator receives the transaction, it consults with other trusted validators and they vote on whether the transaction is valid.</p>

<p>If <strong>80% or more vote it “valid”</strong> - the transaction is updated in the Ripple ledger.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/10.PNG" />
</center>

<p><strong>This list of trusted validators  that a validator consults with is known as a Unique Node List or UNL for short.</strong></p>

<p>Each validator has its own UNL.</p>

<p>Deciding who will be included in the validaor’s UNL is completely up to the person  who runs the validator.</p>

<p>However, Ripple offers a default list of trusted validators.</p>

<p><strong>Validators don’t get compensated for their work like Bitcoin miners do with new coins.</strong></p>

<h2 id="xrp-is-pre-mined">XRP IS PRE-MINED</h2>

<p>When Ripple Labs started out they actually issued, or “pre-mined”, a total of 100 billion XRP and according to the Ripple protocol, no more XRP can ever be created.</p>

<p>Who owns all of these pre-mined coins?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>20 Billion XRP were given to Ripple founders - Jed Macaleb, Chris Larsen and Arthur Britto.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ripple Labs holds around 7 billion XRP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>40 billion XRP have been sold  to companies and individuals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining supply is sealed in a smart contract that releases 1 billion XRP into Ripple Labs’ hands each month.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Until all of the 100 billion XRP cap  will be reached, that is.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/11.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="xrp-extra-facts">XRP EXTRA FACTS</h2>

<p>XRP can be divided into 6 decimal points with the smallest unit being known as a <strong>drop</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to hold XRP you will need a wallet that supports the currency and a <strong>minimum deposit of 20 XRP</strong> in your account.</p>

<p>This is done in order to prevent people from spamming the Ripple Network by opening a large number of accounts.</p>

<p>One last thing to know about XRP is that the <strong>XRP supply decreases over time making it, in theory, more valuable as time passes.</strong></p>

<p>This is done through destroying the transaction fees attached to each XRP transaction.</p>

<p>For example, at the beginning of 2021 we were down to about 99.99% of the original 100 Billion XRP.</p>

<p>The “missing” XRP are transaction fees that have been destroyed and can never be used again.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/12.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="is-it-a-good-investition">IS IT A GOOD INVESTITION?</h2>

<p>When people invest in XRP they are basically betting that in the future banks and institutions will use XRP to move value and will therefore buy XRP and drive up its price.</p>

<p>Of course, banks could always use IOUs instead and that will keep XRP’s price  rather stagnant.</p>

<p>Therefore, the question of  “will XRP rise in value?”, is mainly a question of whether a majority of banks and payment providers choose to utilize it instead of their current infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-decentralized">IS IT DECENTRALIZED?</h2>

<p>Let’s see at the criticism about Ripple being a centralized platform.</p>

<p>There are many arguments for both sides, but I will try to display some of the main points of debate.</p>

<h2 id="key-points">KEY POINTS</h2>

<h4 id="-no-cnotrol-over-the-protocol">(+) NO CNOTROL OVER THE PROTOCOL</h4>

<p>Just like Bitcoin, <strong>once Ripple’s protocol is published, Ripple Labs has no control over it</strong>.</p>

<p>Validators run the code themselves.</p>

<p>This is pretty similar to Bitcoin’s core development team maintaining the Bitcoin protocol but having no real control over the nodes that run it.</p>

<h4 id="---but-still-has-something-to-say">(-) … BUT STILL HAS SOMETHING TO SAY</h4>
<p>But <strong>while Ripple Labs doesn’t control the protocol, it does have a lot of influence</strong> since it is the organization maintaining it.</p>

<p>So, if for some good reason it determined to create more coins, it might succeed.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs is sort of a central bank for RippleNet.</p>

<h4 id="-validators-above-ripple-labs">(+) VALIDATORS ABOVE RIPPLE LABS</h4>

<p><strong>The Ripple protocol itself is open source</strong>, meaning that if Ripple Labs ceases to exist, the validators can still run the network themselves.</p>

<h4 id="--products-arent-open-source-though">(-) PRODUCTS AREN’T OPEN SOURCE THOUGH</h4>

<p>On the other hand, <strong>products the company offers to banks and institutions aren’t open source and are run solely by Ripple Labs</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="--only-few-validators">(-) ONLY FEW VALIDATORS</h4>

<p><strong>The number of Ripple validators today is relatively small</strong>, and is a fraction of the number of Bitcoin nodes that maintain the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Since these relatively few validators are ultimately responsible for maintaining the integrity of the network, this raises the question: how can we know the validators aren’t colluding in order to defraud Ripple’s users?</p>

<h5 id="-i-ou-tokens-demanding-trust">(-)I OU TOKENS DEMANDING TRUST</h5>

<p>Another attribute in Ripple that raises concern is that <strong>you ultimately have to depend on trust in order to use the IOU tokens</strong>.</p>

<p>In contrast, Bitcoin’s entire system is designed to work in a trustless environment.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/13.PNG" />
</center>

<h4 id="--ripple-monitors-and-reports-suspicious-activity-to-authorities">(-) RIPPLE MONITORS AND REPORTS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY TO AUTHORITIES</h4>

<p>Additionally, while Bitcoin is free for all and censorship resistant, <strong>Ripple is committed to monitoring and reporting any Anti-Money Laundering flags  across the network, as well as reporting suspicious activity to relevant authorities</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/14.PNG" />
</center>

<h4 id="-more-energy-efficient-since-theres-no-mining">(+) MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT SINCE THERE’S NO MINING</h4>

<p>On the upside, since there’s no such thing as Ripple mining, <strong>the network itself is much more energy efficient</strong> compared to Bitcoin’s extreme energy consumption.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>

<p>In the end, there’s no clear answer to  whether Ripple is decentralized or not.</p>

<p>The real question of centralization arises when there’s one key figure or company that has implicit power  over what the community thinks.</p>

<p><strong>And in this case, Ripple Labs undoubtedly has the most influence on the entire Ripple community, making it much more centralized in nature than Bitcoin.</strong></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/15.PNG" />
</center>

<p>It’s up to you to decide if you think Ripple is centralized or not, or whether that even matters.</p>

<p>Ripple isn’t built on the same ideals as Bitcoin. It’s a ‘for profit’ company, serving the banking system.</p>

<p>Perhaps this centralized solution is a more efficient means of international transaction, but is it the right one?</p>

<p>Summing up: <strong>Ripple is a network designed to move value around the world, mainly aimed at banks and payment providers.</strong></p>
