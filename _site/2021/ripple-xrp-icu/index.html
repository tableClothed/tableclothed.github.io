  <h5 id="leading-questions">LEADING QUESTIONS</h5>
<p>What is Ripple?</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>Is XRP, Ripple’s cryptocurrency, a good investment?</p>

<p>And what does this all have to do  with the banking system?</p>

<h5 id="international-transactions">INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS</h5>
<p>Today’s topic is Ripple and XRP, one of the leading cryptocurrencies around.</p>

<p>Have you ever had occasion where you  needed to wire money to someone only to be told it might take several days for that money to appear  in their account?</p>

<p>That’s because most major banks are still using systems that were built  40 years ago for this task.</p>

<p>Swift, MoneyGram and Western Union  are just some examples of slow, expensive  and relatively limited systems that financial services use  to transfer money.</p>

<h5 id="transaction-going-through-intermediary-banks">TRANSACTION GOING THROUGH INTERMEDIARY BANKS</h5>
<p>On top of that, not all of the banks are connected  via the same network.</p>

<p>So, in many cases, you don’t even have a direct line  between two banks when they need to transfer money  from one account to the other.</p>

<p>In order for bank A  to send money to bank B that it doesn’t have  any direct relationship with, more often than not it will have to go through  several intermediary banks, searching for common network connections  between each other in order to clear a path for the money.</p>

<p>That’s why international wire transfers  are so slow and costly;</p>

<h5 id="money-conversations">MONEY CONVERSATIONS</h5>
<p>Each bank along the way  takes time to process the transaction and a fee for servicing the process.</p>

<p>In some cases, bank transfers must involve  currency conversions, which make things  even more problematic and expensive.</p>

<p>For example, directly transferring currency  from Japan to Nicaragua, means turning Yens into Cordobas, which is generally not feasible.</p>

<p>The reason is that Japanese banks don’t usually hold accounts  denominated in Cordobas because there’s not  a lot of demand for them.</p>

<p>However, both Japanese  and Nicaraguan banks hold accounts in dollars.</p>

<p>So instead, an individual or bank  will usually trade Yens for Dollars and then Dollars to Cordobas.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this process can be costly  due to the multiple conversions.</p>

<h5 id="ripple-for-banks-to-transfer-ash-around-the-world">RIPPLE FOR BANKS TO TRANSFER ASH AROUND THE WORLD</h5>
<p>In short, the banking system today doesn’t have a main connecting network  with a uniform set of rules.</p>

<p>Each time you want to exchange  or send money through the banking system, you need to find a path  to transfer that money, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what Ripple  is here to change.</p>

<p>Just like the Internet has its own rules,  or protocol, to transfer information known as http. RippleNet uses a protocol,  known as RTXP, for moving value around the world.</p>

<h5 id="ripple-nets">RIPPLE NETS</h5>
<p>Ripple Labs, the creators of RippleNet, aim to create the “Internet of Value” - a way for money to move  as quickly as information does.</p>

<p>Through the use of RippleNet, there is no reason to pay a fortune  and wait days when transferring money globally.</p>

<p>The idea for Ripple  was actually first conceived way back in 2004 by Ryan Fugger and was called RipplePay, but in 2012 was passed to  Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen who founded OpenCoin  later to be called Ripple Labs.</p>

<p>Unlike most cryptocurrencies  who focus on the individual, Ripple Labs aims to serve banks  and payment providers, allowing them to lower transaction costs  and expedite settlements.</p>

<h5 id="how-does-it-work-validators-gateways">HOW DOES IT WORK? VALIDATORS, GATEWAYS</h5>
<p>But how does it all work?</p>

<p>RippleNet is a network based on  a set of rules known as the Ripple Transaction Protocol  or RTXP for short.</p>

<p>The network consists of computers,  known as validators, that are spread around the world and maintain a shared ledger of  who owns what.</p>

<p>Validators make sure every transaction  sent through the network follows the RTXP rules.</p>

<p>Anyone can run a validator  and help maintain the Ripple network just like anyone can run a Bitcoin node  to maintain the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Companies who want to access  the Ripple network can use gateways.</p>

<p>Gateways,  which are usually run by banks, act as entry points to Ripple  for people outside the network.</p>

<p>It’s the same idea as going to a bank  or a credit company to gain access to the banking system.</p>

<p>So Ripple basically offers businesses  an alternative to the banking system in the form of an Internet of value  called RippleNet.</p>

<h5 id="our-money-can-be-on-xrp-and-we-might-not-know">OUR MONEY CAN BE ON XRP AND WE MIGHT NOT KNOW</h5>
<p>Ripple products like xRapid,  xVia and xCurrent are offered to companies  in order to optimize their current solutions for transfering money  around the world.</p>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that for you, as a customer of a financial service  using Ripple, this solution is transparent.</p>

<p>If the bank switches to this technology, your bank account balance  could be residing on the XRP ledger tomorrow and you would never know it.</p>

<h5 id="two-types-of-currency">TWO TYPES OF CURRENCY</h5>
<p>This all sounds great, but what type of currency  can actually be sent through the Ripple Network?</p>

<p>Well, unlike other cryptocurrency protocols  which support only their own asset, Ripple offers  two different types of “currencies”: IOUs and XRP.</p>

<h5 id="iou">IOU</h5>
<p>IOUs are tokens on the Ripple network  that can be stored on any Ripple wallet.</p>

<p>Just like we can store  a variety of Ethereum tokens on an Ethereum wallet, we can have plenty of tokens  coexisting on the same Ripple wallet.</p>

<p>But we really should  stop the comparison here, since this is as far as the similarities go.</p>

<p>Any participant on the Ripple network  can issue an IOU, however an IOU doesn’t represent  something you OWN.</p>

<p>It represents something you OWE.</p>

<p>It’s a debt, an obligation to pay back  something you got in real life.</p>

<p>When I issue an IOU to someone, it means I owe them something.</p>

<p>When I hold an IOU  issued by someone else, it means someone owes me something.</p>

<p>Each IOU has a name  that is comprised out of who issued it and what it represents.</p>

<p>For example, USD.Bitstamp is an IOU  issued by Bitstamp promising to pay back USD dollars.</p>

<p>An IOU can be issued for  any type of real world asset.</p>

<p>For example you can have an IOU for dollars, EUROs,  gold, oil, airline miles and even cows.</p>

<p>For each asset we borrow,  we will issue a new IOU.</p>

<p>Unlike other forms of debt  that can be traded, IOUs for the same asset type  are not interchangeable if they were issued by two different people.</p>

<p>For example, if I borrow money from you  and issue you a 20 USD.Nate IOU, that IOU can’t be added to  a 20 USD.Bitstamp IOU.</p>

<h5 id="depends-on-trust">DEPENDS ON TRUST</h5>

<p>Since each IOU has a different credit line  or trust line you can only redeem  the USD.Nate IOU from me.</p>

<p><strong>It’s important to note that  the IOU itself is not the asset, it’s just a promise by the issuer  to give you the asset back in the future.</strong></p>

<p>This promise won’t do you any good  if the issuer isn’t good for his word.</p>

<p>That’s why trust plays  an important issue with IOUs.</p>

<p>In order for you to accept  an IOU from someone you have to trust that  they will be able to pay you back.</p>

<p>In RippleNet this is known as a trust line.</p>

<p>A trust line is somewhat similar to  a line of credit with the bank.</p>

<p>It’s an agreement to trust someone  up to a limited amount of money.</p>

<h5 id="xrp">XRP</h5>
<p>Aside from IOUs there is another currency  the Ripple protocol supports - XRP.</p>

<p>XRP is a currency issued by Ripple Labs to help transfer payments  through the Ripple Network.</p>

<p>For example, if a bank wants to move  large amounts of money, instead of needing to use  multiple intermediary banks to transfer the money, it can just convert the money to XRP  and send that XRP to the recipient bank.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that two banks don’t have to use XRP  to transfer assets between them.</p>

<p>Instead, they can choose to keep  an ‘open tab’ using IOUs only, without ever closing it.</p>

<h5 id="tradable-asset-and-no-trust-needed">TRADABLE ASSET AND NO TRUST NEEDED</h5>
<p>Still, XRP is a form of payment  that unlike an IOU is final and is considered a tradable asset  by anyone on the network.</p>

<p>Unlike IOUs,  XRP is the actual asset so there is no counterparty risk.</p>

<p>In other words,  once you’ve received payment in XRP, the transaction is made and there’s no fear that the other party  will not meet its obligations for payment.</p>

<h5 id="if-xrp-is-so-cool-why-iou">IF XRP IS SO COOL, WHY IOU?</h5>
<p>So, if no trust is needed  and no trust line needs to be opened when sending XRP  to other network participants, why do we even need IOU?</p>

<p>The simple answer is that XRP,  being a cryptocurrency asset by itself, is relatively volatile  and also not respected worldwide.</p>

<p>IOUs, on the other hand, are treated and valued  as the assets each represent.</p>

<h5 id="more-pros-of-xrp">MORE PROS OF XRP</h5>
<p>XRP has additional advantages as well.</p>

<p>It’s fast and scalable.</p>

<p>Sending an XRP transaction  through the network takes 4 seconds as opposed to Bitcoin’s  10 minute average.</p>

<p>Also, XRP can handle  1,500 transactions per second while Bitcoin can handle only 7.</p>

<p>So the upside of using XRP  as a form of payment is pretty obvious.</p>

<h5 id="can-xrp-be-mined">CAN XRP BE MINED?</h5>
<p>One question people ask us a lot is “if XRP is a cryptocurrency,  can it be mined?”</p>

<p>The answer is - no, it can’t.</p>

<p>Mining in Bitcoin is done  in order to confirm and determine the order of transactions  on the blockchain.</p>

<p>In Ripple transactions are handled  through a different process.</p>

<p>Let me explain:</p>

<h5 id="validators-rules-the-blockchain">VALIDATORS RULES THE BLOCKCHAIN</h5>
<p>When an XRP transaction is broadcast  through the network, the validators that maintain the network  decide if it’s valid or not through voting.</p>

<p>When a validator receives the transaction, it consults with other trusted validators and they vote on whether  the transaction is valid.</p>

<p>If 80% or more vote it “valid” - the transaction is updated  in the Ripple ledger.</p>

<p>This list of trusted validators  that a validator consults with is known as a Unique Node List  or UNL for short.</p>

<p>Each validator has its own UNL.</p>

<p>Deciding who will be included  in the validaor’s UNL is completely up to the person  who runs the validator.</p>

<p>However, Ripple offers  a default list of trusted validators.</p>

<p>Validators don’t get compensated  for their work like Bitcoin miners do with new coins.</p>

<h5 id="xrp-is-pre-mined">XRP IS PRE-MINED</h5>
<p>When Ripple Labs started out they actually issued, or “pre-mined”,  a total of 100 billion XRP and according to the Ripple protocol, no more XRP can ever be created.</p>

<p>You might be wondering, who owns all of these pre-mined coins?</p>

<p>20 Billion XRP  were given to Ripple founders - Jed Macaleb, Chris Larsen  and Arthur Britto.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs holds around 7 billion XRP.</p>

<p>40 billion XRP have been sold  to companies and individuals.</p>

<p>The remaining supply  is sealed in a smart contract that releases 1 billion XRP  into Ripple Labs’ hands each month until all of the 100 billion XRP cap  will be reached.</p>

<h5 id="some-extra-info">SOME EXTRA INFO</h5>
<p>XRP can be divided into 6 decimal points with the smallest unit  being known as a drop.</p>

<p>If you want to hold XRP you will need a wallet  that supports the currency and a minimum deposit of 20 XRP  in your account.</p>

<p>This is done in order to prevent people  from spamming the Ripple Network by opening a large number of accounts.</p>

<h5 id="deflactional">DEFLACTIONAL</h5>
<p>One last thing to know about XRP is that  the XRP supply decreases over time making it, in theory,  more valuable as time passes.</p>

<p>This is done through destroying  the transaction fees attached to each XRP transaction.</p>

<p>For example, at the time of shooting this video we’re down to about 99.99% of  the original 100 Billion XRP.</p>

<p>The “missing” XRP are transaction fees  that have been destroyed and can never be used again.</p>

<h5 id="is-it-a-good-investition">IS IT A GOOD INVESTITION?</h5>
<p>So, is it a good idea to invest in XRP?</p>

<p>When people invest in XRP they are basically betting that in the future banks and institutions  will use XRP to move value and will therefore buy XRP  and drive up its price.</p>

<p>Of course,  banks could always use IOUs instead and that will keep XRP’s price  rather stagnant.</p>

<p>Therefore, the question of  “will XRP rise in value?”, is mainly a question of whether  a majority of banks and payment providers choose to utilize it instead of their current infrastructure.</p>

<h5 id="is-it-decentralized-then">IS IT DECENTRALIZED THEN?</h5>
<p>Before we end this video I want to touch upon one more subject and that’s the criticism about Ripple  being a centralized platform.</p>

<p>There are many arguments for both sides, and while I clearly have my opinion</p>

<p>I will try to display  some of the main points of debate.</p>

<h3 id="key-points">KEY POINTS</h3>

<h5 id="no-cnotrol-over-the-protocol">(+)NO CNOTROL OVER THE PROTOCOL</h5>
<p>Just like Bitcoin, once Ripple’s protocol is published, Ripple Labs has no control over it.</p>

<p>Validators run the code themselves.</p>

<p>This is pretty similar to  Bitcoin’s core development team maintaining the Bitcoin protocol but having no real control  over the nodes that run it.</p>

<h5 id="--but-still-has-something-to-say">(-)… BUT STILL HAS SOMETHING TO SAY</h5>
<p>But while Ripple Labs  doesn’t control the protocol, it does have a lot of influence  since it is the organization maintaining it.</p>

<p>So, if for some good reason  it  determined  to create more coins, it might succeed.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs is sort of  a central bank for RippleNet.</p>

<h5 id="validators-above-ripple-labs">(+)VALIDATORS ABOVE RIPPLE LABS</h5>

<p>The Ripple protocol itself is open source, meaning that if Ripple Labs  ceases to exist, the validators can still run  the network themselves.</p>

<h5 id="-products-arent-open-source-though">(-)PRODUCTS AREN’T OPEN SOURCE THOUGH</h5>

<p>On the other hand, products the company offers  to banks and institutions aren’t open source  and are run solely by Ripple Labs.</p>

<h5 id="-only-few-validators">(-)ONLY FEW VALIDATORS</h5>

<p>The number of Ripple validators today  is relatively small, and is a fraction of the number of Bitcoin nodes  that maintain the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Since these relatively few validators are ultimately responsible for maintaining  the integrity of the network, this raises the question: how can we know the validators  aren’t colluding in order to defraud Ripple’s users?</p>

<h5 id="-iou-tokens-demanding-trust">(-)IOU TOKENS DEMANDING TRUST</h5>

<p>Another attribute in Ripple  that raises concern is that you ultimately have to depend on trust  in order to use the IOU tokens.</p>

<p>In contrast, Bitcoin’s entire system is designed to work  in a trustless environment.</p>

<h5 id="--ripple-monitors-and-reports-suspicious-activity-to-authorities">(-) RIPPLE MONITORS AND REPORTS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY TO AUTHORITIES</h5>

<p>Additionally, while Bitcoin is free for all  and censorship resistant, Ripple is committed to  monitoring and reporting any Anti-Money Laundering flags  across the network, as well as reporting suspicious activity  to relevant authorities.</p>

<h5 id="more-energy-efficient-since-theres-no-mining">(+)MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT SINCE THERE’S NO MINING</h5>

<p>On the upside, since there’s no such thing  as Ripple mining, the network itself  is much more energy efficient compared to Bitcoin’s  extreme energy consumption.</p>

<h5 id="final-thoughts">FINAL THOUGHTS</h5>
<p>In the end, there’s no clear answer to  whether Ripple is decentralized or not.</p>

<p>Personally I think the real  question of centralization arises when there’s one key figure  or company that has implicit power  over what the community thinks.</p>

<p><strong>And in this case, Ripple Labs undoubtedly  has the most influence on the entire Ripple community, making it much more  centralized in nature than Bitcoin.</strong></p>

<p>It’s up to you to decide  if you think Ripple is centralized or not, or whether that even matters.</p>

<p>Ripple isn’t built  on the same ideals as Bitcoin.</p>

<p>It’s a ‘for profit’ company,  serving the banking system.</p>

<p>Perhaps this centralized solution is a more efficient means  of international transaction, but is it the right one?</p>

<p>Hopefully by now you understand  what Ripple is and how it works -</p>

<p>A network designed to move value  around the world, mainly aimed at banks  and payment providers.</p>
