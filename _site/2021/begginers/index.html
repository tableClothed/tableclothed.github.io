<h2 id="what-is-cryptocurrency">WHAT IS CRYPTOCURRENCY?</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are like regular currencies, except they are entirely digital. Each idividual cryptocurrency coin is fundamentally just a collection of numbers and letters.</p>

<h2 id="real-banks-and-physical-money">REAL BANKS AND PHYSICAL MONEY</h2>

<p>Almost every physical money bill on the planet has a unique serial number. 
This serial number corresponds to info like when the bill was printed, where it was printed and so on.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/1.PNG" />
</center>

<p>In theory, a record of all money bills that have ever been printed and where they are, is kept by a cental bank, which shares this info with smaller banks and the government.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/2.PNG" />
</center>

<p>If you have a debit card or credit card you have an account number on there as well.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/3.PNG" />
</center>

<p>You also have a password or PIN number that you use to access the money in that account.</p>

<p>Your bank branch knows your account number and your name, because you had to provide your personal information to open an account. This info is also shared with the central bank and government.</p>

<h2 id="bank-control">BANK CONTROL</h2>

<p>Now let’s say you have a 20 bill with the serial number ABC and your bank account number is 123.</p>

<p>When you deposit that bill into your bank account, your bank branch, the central bank and the government will see and confirm that the 20 bill ABC has been moved into bank account number 123.</p>

<p>This is almost exactly how cryptocurrencies work. Each individual cryptocurrency coin is like the serial number you see on a physical bill just without the physical bill.</p>

<h2 id="satoshis-in-btc">SATOSHIS IN BTC</h2>

<p>Just like regular bills, almost every cryptocurrency can be divided into smaller pieces.</p>

<p>In the case of Bitcoin, each BTC can be divided into 100 million pieces called <strong>Satoshis</strong>, which are like cents to a dollar.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/4.jpg" />
</center>

<h2 id="crypto-wallets">CRYPTO WALLETS</h2>

<p>A cryptocurrency wallet address is like a bank account, except that there’s no physical card that goes along with it.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/5.PNG" />
</center>

<p>It’s just an account number, because you don’t need to provide any personal information to create a cryptocurrency wallet.</p>

<p>This means that your identity is not attached to your crypto wallet like a bank account is.</p>

<p>Most importantly, any cryptocurrency held in your personal wallet is held directly by you, not custodied by a bank like regular money in a bank account.</p>

<p><strong>This means that nobody can shut down your cryptocurrency wallet or block your transactions, because you have total control over that account at all times.</strong></p>

<h2 id="you-can-lose-your-access">YOU CAN LOSE YOUR ACCESS</h2>

<p>The trade-off here is that, if you lose access to your cryptocurrency wallet or forget to write down the recovery phrase, you get when you make one, you’ll lose your cryptocurrency forever.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/6.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="cryptocurrency-network---blockchain-explorer">CRYPTOCURRENCY NETWORK - BLOCKCHAIN EXPLORER</h2>

<p>Instead of banks and the government keeping track of everyone’s bills and bank account balances, these records are stored across all the computers connected to a cryptocurrency network.</p>

<p>These transactions and account balances are public and can be viewed by anyone using something called a blockchain explorer.</p>

<h2 id="secure-decentralization-processing-transactions">SECURE DECENTRALIZATION, PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS</h2>

<p><strong>Because computers can earn cryptocurrency for processing transactions on a cryptocurrency network, this incentivizes more computers to join the network to process transactions and earn cryptocurrency.</strong></p>

<p>This makes cryptocurrency networks secure, because there is no single point of failure.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/7.PNG" />
</center>

<p>This is called <strong>decentralization</strong> and it’s the polar opposite of the centralized setups of governments and banks.</p>

<p>That means the digital currencies banks around the world are creating are not cryptocurrencies. They’re creating a seriously dystopian payment network.</p>

<h2 id="crypto-categories">CRYPTO CATEGORIES</h2>

<p>There are actually thousands of cryptocurrencies just like there are hundreds of different regular currencies US dollars, euros, chinese Yuan and so on.</p>

<p>The crazy thing is that, every cryptocurrency is different and not all of them are designed to be a currency you would actually use for everyday transactions.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking there are two types of cryptocurrencies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>coins</li>
  <li>tokens</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="coins">COINS</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency coins belong to cryptocurrency networks, that were built from the ground up and bought from the ground up.</p>

<p>This means that someone spent a lot of time and a lot of money putting together the code required to create a safe and reliable cryptocurrency network.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency coins are the cryptocurrencies given to computers when they process transactions for a cryptocurrency network.</p>

<p>For example, BTC is a cryptocurrency coin, because the Bitcoin network was built from the ground up and BTC is given to the computers that process transactions for the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p><strong>Because cryptocurrency networks are so hard to make from scratch, only a few dozen cryptocurrencies are actually coins. The rest are cryptocurrency tokens.</strong></p>

<h2 id="tokens">TOKENS</h2>

<p>In contrast to cryptocurrency coins crypto tokens are easy to make and can often be created in a matter of minutes with little to no effort.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/8.PNG" />
</center>

<p>This is why there are tens of thousands of tokens.</p>

<h2 id="ntfs">NTFs</h2>

<p>The NFTs you keep hearing about are actually cryptocurrency tokens, that are like digital certificates of ownership for physical or digital art pieces.</p>

<p>NTFs are just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with tokens.</p>

<h2 id="circle---usdc">CIRCLE - USDC</h2>
<p>There’s a company called Circle, that issues a cryptocurrency token called USDC.</p>

<p>USDC is fully backed by real US dollars, which means that for every one USDC in circulation, circle has one US dollar in the bank.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/9.PNG" />
</center>

<p>You can create USDC by giving them your dollars and redeem your dollars with USDC.</p>

<h2 id="paxos">PAXOS</h2>
<p>Another company called Paxos issues a cryptocurrency token called PAXG.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/10.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Each PAXG token is backed by one troy ounce of gold kept in a vault in London and you can redeem PAXG tokens for real physical gold or US dollars.</p>

<p>The best part is that both Circle and Paxos are fully regulated in the USA and regularly audited to make sure they have the appropriate number of reserves on hand backing their tokens.</p>

<h2 id="security">SECURITY</h2>

<p>Whether a cryptocurrency is safe or not, ultimately depends on the context.</p>

<p>Not all cryptocurrencies are created equal.</p>

<p>Some cryptocurrencies are built to prioritize speed over security and usually the consequences of that play out quite quickly.</p>

<h2 id="hackers">HACKERS</h2>

<p>Luckily, there are always hackers somewhere looking to crack cryptocurrency networks, so they can trick them into creating new coins or tokens out of thin air to sell for a fancy profit.</p>

<p>This might sound scary, but it’s no different to what happens to banks and corporations on a daily basis</p>

<p>When hackers succeed the affected company usually beefs up its cyber security.</p>

<p>The same goes for cryptocurrencies. This means that most cryptos that have been around for years, are robustly battle tested as a consequence of always being under attack by bad actors.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/11.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="computers-spread-around-the-world-that-check-histories-and-balances">COMPUTERS SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD THAT CHECK HISTORIES AND BALANCES</h2>

<p>Some cryptocurrency networks are made up of computers spread out around the world, that are constantly double checking transaction histories and account balances.</p>

<p>If you wanted to corrupt a cryptocurrency network, you would have to hack more than half of all the computers connected to the network at the same time in order to do it.</p>

<h2 id="depends-on-the-currency-though">DEPENDS ON THE CURRENCY THOUGH</h2>

<p>This is impossible to do if you have a cryptocurrency network like Bitcoin, that has millions of computers spread around the world.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/7.PNG" />
</center>

<p>That said, some cryptocurrency networks have fewer computers processing transactions and are therefore more vulnerable to attack.</p>

<h2 id="cryptocurrency-exchanges">CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGES</h2>

<p>The same rule applies to centralized cryptocurrency services like cryptocurrency exchanges, which is where most crypto hacks have happened.</p>

<p>These are much easier and more lucrative to exploit than an individual cryptocurrency wallet, which is insanely secure.</p>

<p>That’s why you should always keep your crypto on your own personal wallet wherever possible and only keep it on an exchange when you’re trading or cashing out.</p>

<h2 id="criminal-activities--monero">CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES &amp; MONERO</h2>

<p>When it comes to criminal activities, it is true that ransom demands made by hackers often involve some kind of cryptocurrency, while the cryptocurrency these hackers demand is often Bitcoin.</p>

<p>They almost always exchange that Bitcoin for a privacy oriented cryptocurrency, like Monero, as soon as they can.</p>

<p>This is because Bitcoin and most other cryptos have publicly viewable transactions and wallet balances.</p>

<p>This makes Bitcoin transactions very easy to trace by authorities, even more than regular currencies.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/12.PNG" />
</center>

<p>So it makes no sense for criminals to actively use and hold a currency that’s so easily tracked.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies like Monero are completely private and even the US government can’t crack its encryption, which is seriously impressive.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/13.PNG" />
</center>

<p>If you think about it in sum, then the overwhelming majority of cryptocurrencies are not used for criminal purposes.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/14.PNG" />
</center>

<p>There are just a handful of cryptos that are actively used by criminals.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-risk">THE REAL RISK</h2>

<p>The real risk when it comes to crypto relates to investing.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, meaning their prices can go up or down by up to 50% in a day.</p>

<h2 id="attention---leverage-trading">ATTENTION - LEVERAGE TRADING!</h2>

<p>Investing too much in crypto can be extremely dangerous, especially when you push your luck with something called <strong>leverage trading</strong>, which basically uses borrowed money.</p>

<p>That’s why you should only invest what you’re willing to lose and not a penny more.</p>

<h2 id="volatility">VOLATILITY</h2>

<p>Why are cryptocurrencies so volatile? What gives them any value to begin with?</p>

<p>First of all, what gives the money in your wallet or in your bank any value?</p>

<p>Once upon a time, it was backed by gold, but that changed, and since then all state issued currencies around the world have been losing value.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/15.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="its-only-trust">IT’S ONLY TRUST</h2>

<p>This is because the only thing that backs dollars and euros is ultimately the trust we have in the governments that issue those currencies, and that trust has been eroding for decades.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/16.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Not only that, but governments have been actively printing and manipulating their currencies to benefit themselves and the corporations that fund them at the expense of the average person.</p>

<p>This has caused record levels of inflation that incentivizes spending over saving, which leads to over consumption, and causes the sort of environmental catastrophes, they claim to want to stop.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/17.jpg" />
</center>

<h2 id="back-to-crypto">BACK TO CRYPTO</h2>

<p><strong>Cryptocurrencies are valuable because of what they do.</strong></p>

<p>Obviously this value changes depending on which cryptocurrency we’re talking about.</p>

<h2 id="btc-value">BTC VALUE</h2>

<p><strong>Bitcoin has value, because its BTC coin has an economic profile similar to gold.</strong></p>

<p>It has a <strong>maximum supply</strong> and <strong>only a small amount of BTC is created each day</strong> and that amount is cut in half every 4 years.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/26.jpg" />
</center>

<p>Assuming demand for Bitcoin stays the same over time, this would lead to a doubling of Bitcoin’s price every 4 years.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/19.jpg" />
</center>

<p>However, demand for Bitcoin has increased over time, as we realize how weak regular currencies can be, and this awareness has been enhanced by the current pandemic.</p>

<p>As basic economics dictate, when something has a limited supply, but the demand for it continues to increase prices inevitably rise.</p>

<p>Many investors also see Bitcoin as a safe place to park your capital outside of the current financial system.</p>

<p>One important thing to note, is that most other cryptocurrencies are highly correlated to Bitcoin, meaning their prices are reliant on what BTC does.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/20.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="eth-value">ETH VALUE</h2>

<p><strong>Some cryptos, such as Ethereum, have insane value due to the utility they provide.</strong></p>

<p>The ethereum network can be used to create those cryptocurrency tokens mentioned earlier, and you can even create decentralized applications and websites that <strong>can’t be censored or shut down</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/21.jpg" />
</center>

<h2 id="gas-fees">GAS FEES</h2>

<p>All transactions related to creating and moving tokens and interacting with these applications require Ether to pay for <strong>gas fees</strong>.</p>

<p>This means the demand for ETH rises as the Ethereum network gains adoption and Ethereum has seen some serious adoption.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/21.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Visa is testing payments on the Ethereum network using that USDC token mentioned earlier, and the European Central Bank even issued a bond on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/22.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="why-it-fluctuates-so-much-no-one-knows-what-the-tech-is-worth">WHY IT FLUCTUATES SO MUCH? NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE TECH IS WORTH</h2>

<p>Now, the reason why the value of BTC, ETH and every other cryptocurrency fluctuates so much each day, is because basically <strong>nobody knows what these technologies are actually worth</strong>.</p>

<p>The prices of stocks and gold, and even regular currencies, fluctuate every day for the same reason, but <strong>cryptocurrencies are much more volatile because what they do is revolutionary</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/23.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="everything-together-against-giants-and-politics">EVERYTHING TOGETHER AGAINST GIANTS AND POLITICS</h2>

<p>Cryptocurrency networks make it possible to lend, save and borrow without an identity credit score or bank.</p>

<p>They make it possible to do business directly with other people, without a middleman taking a cut, meaning service giants like Uber and tech giants like Facebook could become obsolete.</p>

<p>They make it possible for communities to pool their funds together and vote on how they should be spent, which could eventually cut out the needs for governments and their crooked politicians.</p>

<h2 id="makes-investors-emotional">MAKES INVESTORS EMOTIONAL</h2>

<p>Now, this potential makes the average crypto investor very emotional.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/24.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The slightest possibility of a clampdown on crypto results in a market crash, and the most outlandish rumor can lead to a massive market pump in the longer term.</p>

<p>However, you can see that crypto is growing and that growth is unlikely to stop anytime soon.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/25.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Fun fact; buying and holding cryptocurrency will give you about the same amount of profit as actively trading crypto, which I don’t recommend you do, unless you plan on making it your full-time job.</p>

<h2 id="what-crypto-should-i-buy-important-metrics-to-look-at">WHAT CRYPTO SHOULD I BUY? IMPORTANT METRICS TO LOOK AT</h2>

<p>When it comes to risk tolerance, it might sound a bit funny, considering cryptocurrencies are risky investments, but there are varying degrees of risk, even within the crypto market.</p>

<p>Logically, the more risk you’re willing to take, the greater reward you stand to gain.</p>

<p>Now, the easiest way to measure risk and reward is to look at a cryptocurrency’s market cap.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/27.PNG" />
</center>

<p>This is an extremely important metric to check, because the dollar value of cryptocurrencies can be misleading.</p>

<h2 id="market-cap">MARKET CAP</h2>

<p><strong>A cryptocurrency’s market cap is calculated by the current value of that coin or token times its circulating supply.</strong></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/28.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The reason why Dogecoin is ranked so high, is because it has a circulating supply of 130 billion, and when you multiply that by Dogecoin’s 30 cent price, you get a 40 plus billion dollar market cap.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/29.PNG" />
</center>

<p>You might think that Dogecoin presents you with an easy opportunity to get rich quick, but getting to just 1 dollar would require an additional 80 billion dollars of active investment, and that isn’t all that likely to happen.</p>

<p><strong>As a rule of thumb, the smaller the market cap, the more potential that cryptocurrency has to grow, regardless of its dollar value.</strong></p>

<p>That’s because it takes less money to increase its value.</p>

<h2 id="yarnfinance">YARN.FINANCE</h2>

<p>To use an extreme example, Yearn Finance’s YFI token is worth more than Bitcoin, but its market cap is 20 times smaller than Dogecoin’s, meaning, it would take less capital to push up the price of YFI.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/30.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="look-only-at-the-top-100-coins">LOOK ONLY AT THE TOP 100 COINS</h2>

<p>With the exception of Dogecoin and a couple of others, most of the cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap, could be considered low risk investments.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/31.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano are likely to be around for many years, and they will likely double, if not triple, in price before this bull market is over.</p>

<p>The other 90 cryptocurrencies in the top 100 could still see gains of 3 to 5x, but the further you move down the list, the riskier the investment becomes, because it also takes less capital to crash their price.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/beginner/32.PNG" />
</center>

<p>I would personally stay away from any crypto, that isn’t among the top 200 by market cap.</p>
