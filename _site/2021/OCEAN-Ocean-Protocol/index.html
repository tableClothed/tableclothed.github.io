<h2 id="global-data-economy">GLOBAL DATA ECONOMY</h2>

<p>Let’s start with a talk about the global data economy.</p>

<p>The data economy encompasses a load of different aspects. That includes things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>data generation,</li>
  <li>storage processing,</li>
  <li>distribution analysis, and</li>
  <li>exploitation.</li>
</ul>

<p>No one truly knows, how big the data economy has gotten, but here’s a fun stat from a European Commission Study.</p>

<p>They estimated that the value of the European data market would be around <strong>739 billion euros</strong> by 2020.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/1.PNG" />
</center>

<p>So when you factor in the rest of the world, we are probably talking about a market worth trillions of dollars a year.</p>

<p>The truth is that a single user is generating an increasing amount of data =.</p>

<p>Here is how much data the world is producing every second:</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/2.PNG" />
</center>

<p>So according to those chaps at the UN, the world sends over 2.7 million emails a second, spends an ungodly amount of time on Youtube and creates about 289,000 GB of data every second.</p>

<p>To put that into perspective, that amount of data is the same amount, that can be stored on just over 1,100 Macbook pros.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-with-this-data">WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS DATA</h2>

<p>One key: data consumer is AI. Particularly Deep Learning.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that, experience has shown that the more data you have, the better these models become, and that means your models can capture more value.</p>

<h2 id="why-data-is-so-crucial">WHY DATA IS SO CRUCIAL?</h2>

<p>The reason why data is valuable is that, it leads to better AI.</p>

<p>The result is that many big tech companies are incentivized to hoard data and sell it.</p>

<p>That’s a fancy way of saying they don’t want to share it with anyone else.</p>

<p>After all, that data can potentially give a business a huge advantage, which would lead to bigger profits, which can then be invested in capturing more data.</p>

<p>They aren’t called <em>data barons</em> for no reason.</p>

<p>That all creates a crazy data feedback loop, and is why we see the amount of data generated by the world increase year by year.</p>

<p>So yes, there’s a mad scramble for data right now.</p>

<p>The really crazy thing is that, according to McKinsey, <strong>less than 1% of that collected data is actually analyzed</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/3.PNG" />
</center>

<p>That means that <strong>the vast majority of the world’s data is literally being stockpiled on servers and not being used</strong>.</p>

<p>That seems like a massive waste, when that data could be helpful in solving some of the world’s biggest problems.</p>

<p>The truth is that AI is improving because of improved techniques and the ever increasing amount of data to feed them.</p>

<p>What’s important to know with AI is that, it’s damn data hungry, and needs an astronomical amount of quality and relevant data sets to deliver meaningful value.</p>

<p>That means the barrier to developing AI tech is high, and is why AI talent tends to concentrate in companies with a plentiful amount of data to use.</p>

<p>That’s also compounded by the fact that the likes of Microsoft and Facebook tend to hoover up the best talent, while these youngsters are still at university, to prevent competitors getting a chance to hire them.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/4.PNG" />
</center>

<p>This creates a feedback loop, that basically just benefits a few tech giants and no one else.</p>

<p>However, some truly amazing stuff has been achieved with it already, thanks to AI and a ton of data.</p>

<p>We live in a world, where image recognition using computers is now better than what humans can do.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/5.png" />
</center>

<p>That recognition is pretty damn useful when it comes to unlocking your Iphone with face ID, for example.</p>

<p>The downside can be seen over in China, where the government seems to like tracking people’s every move.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/6.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The point is that AI has come on leaps and bounds over the last 10 years already.</p>

<p>There are quite a few other tasks AI can do better than humans.</p>

<p>Another example is the game of Go where Google fed its AI with an insane amount of data, and that AI ended up beating a Go grand master.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/7.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="usage-of-ai">USAGE OF AI</h2>

<p>So, what’s the main problem in the current data economy?</p>

<p>You know, how the likes of Facebook are hoarding all that data and not using it.</p>

<p>That creates problems connecting problem owners to problem solvers and giving them access to the required tools and resources.</p>

<p>As an example: climate change.</p>

<p>Maybe the United Nations wants to solve that problem and get a bunch of first-class climate scientists to start working on finding a solution.</p>

<p>However, they might want to access private data from another country to help solve that problem.</p>

<p>Basically, connecting all these actors and getting that private data is really difficult.</p>

<p>So that poses a major question: how can we unlock access to private data?</p>

<p>After all, that’s probably the most valuable data.</p>

<h2 id="ocean-protocol-goals">OCEAN PROTOCOL GOALS</h2>

<p>Ocean Protocol wants to be a unified layer or substrate, that connects these 3 main pillars of the problem solution and data or AI.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/11.png" />
</center>

<p>The proposed solution is allowing problem solvers to go to one decentralized place, that acts as a sort of public utility, and connects them with the resources they need, to solve that problem.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, Ocean Protocol wants to be that connecting layer.</p>

<p>Another cool thing with Ocean Protocol is that, it wants to unlock access to private data, and allow people to use it without the data being released into the wild.</p>

<p>In other words, they want to protect that private data, but allow data scientists to train models with that data.</p>

<p>The project solution is to create a data privacy zone.</p>

<p>This allows a data scientist to send their algorithm into it, test their model with that data, and allow the findings to be extracted.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-ocean-work">HOW DOES OCEAN WORK</h2>

<p>In short, Ocean Protocol is a decentralized Ethereum powered smart contract platform, running on proof-of-authority.</p>

<p>This enables the safe sharing of data, and ensures payment to the data provider, whilst guaranteeing control auditability and transparency to everyone.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/12.PNG" />
</center>

<p>You might have a user that wants to use a library to interact with Ocean Protocol.</p>

<p>The protocol itself is kept alive by nodes called <strong>Keepers</strong>, which are ultimately responsible for ensuring, that the network is running optimally</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/13.png" />
</center>

<p>Then there is something called the <strong>Parity Secret Store</strong>, which keeps that private data private.</p>

<p>You then have <strong>2 key Micro Services</strong>.</p>

<p>The first is a component called the <strong>Brezo Cloud Services Manager</strong>, which acts as a proxy to preserve your privacy, but allows you to access data on the platform.</p>

<p>next you have a metadata store called <strong>Aquarius</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/14.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="ai-assets">AI ASSETS</h2>

<p>AI Assets basically have 3 core separate components on Ocean Protocol.</p>

<p>The first is that, assets are registered on the blockchain, meaning that each asset has its own unique ID.</p>

<p>Secondly, it has metadata attached to it, which describes the asset or data set.</p>

<p>And finally, the data needs to be stored somewhere.</p>

<p>What are these mentioned AI Assets?</p>

<p>You could register raw data and publish it as an asset using Ocean Protocol.</p>

<p>However, look at the data science workflow.</p>

<p>Right here you’ll probably notice that model pipelines, trained weights or pre-trained data models and metrics could all be pretty valuable AI Assets.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/15.png" />
</center>

<p>You could register all of these as assets on the platform too and retain ownership of them via a private key.</p>

<p>After all, it can take a huge amount of effort to create model pipelines, train data models and determine metrics.</p>

<p>So it can be really useful to share these assets, and potentially monetize them.</p>

<p>Once that AI Asset is published using Ocean Protocol, it’s searchable by anyone in the world.</p>

<p>Even better, because the asset is on a blockchain, it’s very difficult to censor.</p>

<p>That’s damn useful for people like journalists in authoritarian countries, who might want to share data proving corruption for example.</p>

<p>And speaking about money related data that’s usually pretty sensitive.</p>

<h2 id="how-people-can-use-sensitive-data">HOW PEOPLE CAN USE SENSITIVE DATA?</h2>

<p>How can people safely use sensitive data, like your banking history?</p>

<p>That sounds terrible, but who knows, maybe some geek kid can solve all of the world’s socio-economic problems with access to that sort of data at scale?</p>

<p>The important thing here is that, you certainly don’t want that type of data being released into the wild.</p>

<p>You don’t even want people to be able to download that data onto their computer, while giving them the option to give it or sell it to someone else.</p>

<p>Basically, Ocean Protocol solves all that by keeping the data behind a firewall, and only allowing participants, using that data, to send in their algorithm, train it privately and create a private model.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/16.png" />
</center>

<p>This model will only release predictions to the user.</p>

<p>So, to summarise: Ocean Protocol is powering a two-sided data market with data providers on one side, and data consumers on the other.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/17.png" />
</center>

<p>That’s pretty good news for AI and could potentially add significant value to that niche.</p>

<h2 id="ocean-token-value">OCEAN TOKEN VALUE</h2>

<p>However, a more important question is that concerning the value of the OCEAN token.</p>

<p>In short, the OCEAN utility token is used as the unit of exchange for buying and selling data AI assets and AI services.</p>

<p>So if there’s no data changing hands using the Protocol, then the token is pretty worthless.</p>

<p>For example, let’s look at AirBnB marketplace.</p>

<p>If you have a lot of customers, who want vacation rentals and no properties listed for hire, then the platform would not have been successful.</p>

<p>That’s why platforms like this initially focus on building up inventory on the platform, before looking to send buyers over there.</p>

<h2 id="ways-to-earn-ocean-token">WAYS TO EARN OCEAN TOKEN</h2>

<p>Basically, there will be 4 ways to earn OCEAN tokens:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>you can provide data quality control,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>curate the data,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>open up a marketplace on the Protocol,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be a network keeper and provide validation and verification services to the network.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/17.1.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="tokenomics">TOKENOMICS</h2>

<p>What’s super interesting is that, the teams allocated 51% of all OCEAN tokens to be distributed as rewards to incentivize just that.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/18.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Given that OCEAN’s current circulating supply is around 434 million, this means that only around 30 of the maximum supply has been released.</p>

<p>So that’s going to mean quite a lot of inflation for holders.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/19.PNG" />
</center>

<p>However, it’s not yet been decided exactly how Ocean will distribute that 51% of the tokens as rewards.</p>

<p>What is for sure though is that, at current valuation Ocean has a sizable war chest to incentivize those value-creating behaviors.</p>

<p>The really crazy thing is that big data sales hit 187 billion dollars in 2019.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/20.PNG" />
</center>

<p>So if Ocean Protocol can even grab a fraction of that market, then there’s going to be a sizable demand for OCEAN tokens to buy all that data.</p>

<p>Given that OCEAN has a hard cap of 1.41 billion, OCEAN then an increase in demand for the OCEAN token should lead to an increase in price.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/21.PNG" />
</center>

<p>So right now, any OCEAN holders should expect an inflation-driven economic model to incentivize things, like data provision.</p>

<p>However, that should be at least partially offset when staking goes live, as this will take tokens off the tradable supply.</p>

<h2 id="coinbase-listing">COINBASE LISTING</h2>

<p>In other news, Coinbase said it was “<em>reviewing 19 cryptocurrencies for possible listings</em>” and Ocean Protocol was amongst them.</p>

<p>So if you’re the type of person, that thinks Coinbase listings are good for price, you might want to keep tabs on that.</p>

<p>But do remember that right now demand for the OCEAN token is being driven by speculation, and that its value will only be validated, if Ocean Protocol succeeds in creating a successful data marketplace.</p>

<p>Even then price appreciation will be driven by demand supply imbalances.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/22.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="protofile---partnership-with-filecoin">PROTOFILE - PARTNERSHIP WITH FILECOIN</h2>

<p>In July, Ocean announced that its partner Protofire had successfully completed integration with FileCoin storage.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/23.jpeg" />
</center>

<p>That basically means that the project now boasts all of FileCoin’s decentralized cloud storage capabilities.</p>

<p>For those of you, who don’t know what FileCoin is, it’s a yet to be released decentralized cloud storage protocol.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ocean/24.PNG" />
</center>

<p>What the Protofire integration means is that, it’s possible to tailor a strategy in terms of software redundancy and the speed of data retrieval.</p>

<p>For each marketplace users can now either self-host data or store it on the IPFS Protocol.</p>

<p>That brings it a greater range of customizable options in a decentralized way.</p>

<p>As a direct result of the integration with FileCoin, data providers have more configurable options for things like data replication and extraction, geographic distribution of access rights and better control over the size of the data stored.</p>

<p>On top of that, data publishers don’t need to rely on middlemen to manage storage resources and are even able to cut costs.</p>

<h2 id="current-problems-with-data">CURRENT PROBLEMS WITH DATA</h2>

<p>So, as you see, there is a real problem in the traditional data markets.</p>

<p>The more we create, the more we’re forced to entrust it to a handful of companies, who then exploit it for profit.</p>

<p>The problem is that, the majority of data is being captured by a small number of powerful tech firms.</p>

<p>It’s unlikely that they’ll be happy sharing any of it with any competitors, and that includes decentralized alternatives like the Ocean Protocol.</p>

<p>There’s no doubt that the vast majority of data is unlikely to ever be listed on a decentralized marketplace.</p>

<p>What sorts of data will end up on Ocean Protocol then? Will it be in any meaningful quantity?</p>

<p>The problem with incentivizing data providers is that, it doesn’t mean they’ll supply good data, that data consumers are willing to buy.</p>

<p>Indeed, that is why curators have such a critical role to play here.</p>

<h2 id="does-ocean-make-sense">DOES OCEAN MAKE SENSE?</h2>

<p>Ocean’s solution to allow people to use private data in a responsible way, seems pretty ingenious and it could be seen, why that would be appealing.</p>

<p>However it must be noted, that there is a roadblock in terms of getting people to trust that system, and entrusting it with private data.</p>

<p>When it comes to tokenomics, Ocean will use a big chunk of the total supply to fuel the adoption of the Protocol.</p>

<p>Fundamentally this makes sense, and it’s alright to agree with all the behaviors, they intend to incentivize with these funds.</p>

<p>If Ocean Protocol is successful in providing that data marketplace with blockchain superpowers, then any inflation should be more than offset by the net increase in demand for the token to buy and sell data.</p>

<p>However, this really only holds true in the event of sustained growth.</p>

<p>In theory, if buy and sell volume on the Ocean Protocol stayed stagnant and data sellers converted OCEAN instantly into Bitcoin or Fiat, then there wouldn’t really be any net increase in demand for the token.</p>

<p>This could then lead to a stagnant token price.</p>

<p>With all that being said, Ocean Protocol is certainly competing in a niche with tremendous upside.</p>

<p>There are also short-term catalysts like those rumblings of a Coinbase listing, that makes it the type of token, that’s predisposed to be speculated on in the short term.</p>

<p>Will Ocean Protocol pull it off and disrupt data markets?</p>

<p>Only time will tell.</p>
