<h2 id="bitcoin---comparison-with-gold">BITCOIN - COMPARISON WITH GOLD</h2>

<p>There is a reason why Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold.</p>

<p>This is because like gold, Bitcoin has a maximum supply, and while gold has utility in electronics and medicine, Bitcoin has utility as a network, that allows you to safely transfer and store value without a middleman.</p>

<p>This combination of scarcity and utility is what gives gold and Bitcoin their incredible value.</p>

<p>However, there’s one big difference between gold and Bitcoin, and this is that Bitcoin relies on the creation of new Bitcoin to reward miners to process transactions on the network.</p>

<p>When all the gold gets mined, it will still be possible to exchange it, but what happens when all the Bitcoin is mined?</p>

<p>Will the Bitcoin network grind to a halt, and bring the entire cryptocurrency space crashing down with it?</p>

<p>How long do we have before this happens? Is there a solution to this problem?</p>

<h2 id="quick-recap-of-btc-history">QUICK RECAP OF BTC HISTORY</h2>

<p>The first Bitcoin block was mined on the 3rd of January 2009, presumably by Bitcoin’s creator Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/1.jpg" />
</center>

<p>Bitcoin’s genesis block contained a hidden message, which read <em>“The time’s 3rd of January 2009. Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”</em>, which was the headline in the <em>London Times</em> newspaper on that day.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/2.png" />
</center>

<p>In addition to this message Bitcoin’s first block contained the first ever cryptocurrency mining reward of 50 BTC.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/3.jpg" style="max-width:500px" />
</center>

<h2 id="why-even-having-bitcoin">WHY EVEN HAVING BITCOIN?</h2>

<p>The rationale behind having BTC coins at all is that, they serve as an economic incentive for miners to maintain the network.</p>

<p>BTC is given as a reward for processing transactions, which are written to blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>

<p>New BTC are issued every time a new Bitcoin block is mined.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin code ensures that this happens roughly every 10 minutes by adjusting the mining difficulty depending on how many miners there are.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/3.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="bitcoin-halving">BITCOIN HALVING</h2>

<p>The Bitcoin block reward was 50 BTC until November 28th 2012, when Bitcoin underwent its first halving reducing the block reward from 50 BTC to 25 BTC.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/4.PNG" />
</center>

<p>A Bitcoin halving happens every 210,000 blocks.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/5.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="why-halvings-are-significant">WHY HALVINGS ARE SIGNIFICANT</h2>

<p>Although this technically works out to 4 years, the actual figure is a bit different.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin halvings are significant, because the sudden reduction in new BTC supply they cause is thought to eventually cause a spike in the price of BTC, assuming demand for BTC stays the same, or increases after the halving case.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/6.PNG" />
</center>

<p>In point, the most recent Bitcoin halving happened in May of 2020 and was followed by a bull run.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/7.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Anyway, these bitcoin halvings aren’t going to keep happening forever.</p>

<p>That’s because the maximum amount of BTC, that can ever be mined, is 21 million, and this limit is built into Bitcoin’s code.</p>

<p>It is likely, that Satoshi Nakamoto chose this limit for mathematical reasons.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/8.PNG" />
</center>

<p>That said, it is also possible that he chose this limit based on the world’s M1 money supply, which was around 21 trillion dollars in 2009.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/9.PNG" />
</center>

<p>If this is the case, then it means Satoshi intended each BTC to eventually be worth one million dollars.</p>

<h2 id="when-will-the-last-btc-be-mined">WHEN WILL THE LAST BTC BE MINED?</h2>

<p>Well, if you’ve googled this question before, you probably got this answer, which is the year 2140.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/10.PNG" />
</center>

<p>NThat seems a long time given the current circulating supply of BTC is around 18.8 million, right?</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/11.PNG" />
</center>

<p>When you dig deeper into the calculation used by most articles to come to this figure, you’ll notice, it assumes that Bitcoin undergoes a halving every 4 years, which is not entirely correct.</p>

<p>Take a look at the dates for the last 3 Bitcoin halvings. Notice, they’re not exactly 4 years apart.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/12.PNG" />
</center>

<p>In fact, they’re only about 3 years and 9 months apart.</p>

<p>Thankfully someone else did the maths on this, and they found out that if you assume this 3 year and 9 month gap continues, the last BTC will probably be mined at the end of 2078.</p>

<h2 id="oh-no-market-dies-">OH NO, MARKET DIES :(</h2>

<p>When there’s no more BTC to mine, there will be no more economic incentives for miners and the Bitcoin network will die, and since the entire cryptocurrency market is dependent on Bitcoin, every cryptocurrency will go to zero.</p>

<p><em>… Said no one ever.</em></p>

<h2 id="end-of-bitcoins-reigns-on-market">END OF BITCOIN’S REIGNS ON MARKET</h2>

<p>First of, Bitcoin dominance has been dropping like a rock since 2017, which suggests that BTC will not be the largest cryptocurrency by market cap in 2078, meaning the rest of the crypto market will not be as dependent on it anymore.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/13.jpg" />
</center>

<h2 id="how-much-do-the-miners-get">HOW MUCH DO THE MINERS GET?</h2>

<p>Also besides what the BTC miners get from each new Bitcoin block, they also earn fees as compensation for processing transactions.</p>

<p>Looking at a Bitcoin block explorer, you can see the amount of fees in BTC a miner earned from the block that they mined by subtracting the current BTC rewards from the total block reward.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/14.PNG" />
</center>

<p>In this case we can see that miners are earning anywhere between 0.5 to 1 BTC per block in transaction fees alone.</p>

<p>Many people believe that by the time the BTC mining rewards run out, these transaction fees will be enough to sustain the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>There’s just one problem with this hypothesis.</p>

<h2 id="lightning-network">LIGHTNING NETWORK</h2>

<p>Given that Bitcoin can only process around 7 transactions per second, it’s very unlikely that it’s going to become the payment network, that is used for microtransactions, like buying a pack of gum at a grocery store.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/17.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The transaction fees alone would be multiples of what you were spending.</p>

<p>Bitcoin developers are very much aware of the growing cost of transaction fees, and how they disrupt micro payments.</p>

<p>It’s why they’ve been developing layer 2 scaling solutions, like the <strong>Lightning Network</strong>, for years.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/18.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The problem with layer 2 solutions, like the Lightning Network, is that, they reduce the number of transactions that actually occur on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>

<p>Instead they only submit transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain when a payment channel is opened and when it is closed.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/18.5.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="high-fees-on-the-lightning-network-not-profitable-for-miners">HIGH FEES ON THE LIGHTNING NETWORK NOT PROFITABLE FOR MINERS</h2>

<p>Fewer transactions mean that the fees for opening and closing these payment channels would have to be incredibly high for Bitcoin miners to remain profitable and operational.</p>

<p>After all, they have to cover the cost of the hardware and electricity required to maintain the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>These high fees would then put pressure on layer 2 like the Lightning Network, to minimize the opening and closing of their payment channels, resulting in a vicious cycle that would either bankrupt Bitcoin miners or corrupt the Bitcoin network due to excessive reliance on less secure layer 2 solutions.</p>

<h2 id="transaction-fees-problem">TRANSACTION FEES PROBLEM</h2>

<p>Bitcoin maximalists will disagree, but it seems quite clear that Bitcoin’s main stick is as a store of value, not as a currency network that’s used for day-to-day transactions.</p>

<p>As such it is much more likely, that BTC will seldom be moved around in the future contrary to what Satoshi Nakamoto envisioned.</p>

<p>This means that if Bitcoin is going to survive beyond the data that stops rewarding miners with BTC, it will need to be able to do so without relying on transaction fees.</p>

<p>Here are a few solutions to that on the horizon.</p>

<h2 id="green-energy">GREEN ENERGY</h2>

<p>As mentioned a few moments ago, sustaining a proof-of-work cryptocurrency network like Bitcoin requires a lot of computing power, and a lot of electricity.</p>

<p>These make up the bulk of the operating expenses of cryptocurrency miners around the world.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/19.PNG" />
</center>

<p>And it’s why a lot of mining farms flock to countries and regions with cheap energy, namely China and parts of North America.</p>

<p>Even though the Bitcoin network is unlikely to survive on transaction fees alone, this is based on the assumption that the cost of cryptocurrency mining will be the same, when we run out of BTC.</p>

<p>However, it is very likely, that energy will become cheaper and technology will become more efficient in the coming decades.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/20.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Although green energy solutions are still very much in their infancy, green energy providers here in the UK are actually using their excess power to mine cryptocurrencies.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/21.PNG" />
</center>

<p>This makes their services even more profitable, and allows them to expand their green energy operations much the chagrin of the fudsters, who claim that cryptocurrency mining is killing the planet.</p>

<h2 id="cheap-energy-and-efficient-hardware">CHEAP ENERGY AND EFFICIENT HARDWARE</h2>

<p>Moreover, Bitcoin mining rigs are becoming more affordable and more efficient by the year.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/22.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Cheap energy and efficient hardware would make it easy for Bitcoin miners to stay profitable using transaction fees alone, and it would even further decentralize Bitcoin.</p>

<p>As new miners join the network to get a share of those fees economic incentives, aren’t the only thing that could keep the Bitcoin network afloat either.</p>

<h2 id="governments-and-investors-join">GOVERNMENTS AND INVESTORS JOIN?</h2>

<p>Ever since companies like Microstrategy began accumulating Bitcoin as part of their treasury reserves, many have been speculating when the public sector will follow suit.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/23.PNG" />
</center>

<p>It seems that it’s only a matter of time, given that the mayor of Miami recently considered investing 1% of the city’s treasury reserves into BTC.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/24.PNG" />
</center>

<p>If and when cities states and even governments begin holding BTC as part of their reserves, they will have all the incentive in the world to make sure, the Bitcoin network remains secure and operational.</p>

<p>If public institutions are holding BTC, after the last one is mined, and they find out that Bitcoin miners are starting to shut off their mining rigs, because they’re not making profits, they probably would not hesitate to subsidize those miners, or even start their own mining operations to sustain the Bitcoin network.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/25.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Similarly, if enough people in a given country hold BTC and the Bitcoin network is at risk, they could pressurize their government to implement subsidies for Bitcoin mining farms to protect their wealth.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/26.PNG" />
</center>

<p>These protectionist measures may not come from just the public sector either.</p>

<p>If enough private companies start to hold large amounts of BTC, they too would have reason to rush in and make sure the Bitcoin network remains operational.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/27.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="bitcoin-moves-to-nodes">BITCOIN MOVES TO NODES</h2>

<p>This skin in the game principle is what motivates people to run Bitcoin nodes, which store copies of transaction histories on the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>

<p>To support the network’s decentralization, there are over 6,400 Bitcoin nodes.</p>

<p>Even though they do not earn any transaction fees or mining rewards for the valuable service, they provide.</p>

<h2 id="bitcoin-on-a-smart-contract-blockchain">BITCOIN ON A SMART CONTRACT BLOCKCHAIN?</h2>

<p>Another possibility is that, we could simply see the entire Bitcoin network migrate to a smart contract blockchain like Ethereum.</p>

<p><strong>Almost 7% of Bitcoin circulating supply is currently on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token as WBTC and RENBTC.</strong></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/28.PNG" />
</center>

<p>This is thanks to something called <strong>wrapping</strong>, which locks a cryptocurrency on its native blockchain to mint an equivalent amount of ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/29.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="wrapped-btcs">WRAPPED BTCs</h2>

<p>The amount of wrapped BTC has increased substantially over the past year and this is for two reasons.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/30.PNG" />
</center>

<ul>
  <li>First, you can use wrapped BTC in various DeFi protocols to earn interest on your BTC.</li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/31.PNG" />
</center>

<ul>
  <li>Second, it’s usually faster and cheaper to move WBTC around than actual BTC.</li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/32.PNG" />
</center>

<p>It’s not just Ethereum.</p>

<p>Either Cardano and Polkadot are expected to roll out their smart contract functionalities in 2021 and Polkadot announced in October 2020, that they will be supporting wrapped BTC on their network in Q1 of this year as Polka BTC.</p>

<p>By the time the BTC rewards run out, Ethereum, Polkadot and Cardano would be insanely decentralized, meaning there would be little to no issues as far as network security goes.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/33.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The only challenge would be migrating all the BTC on the Bitcoin blockchain to Ethereum, which is likely something that not every BTC holder would be willing to do.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/34.PNG" />
</center>

<p>That said, it is very doable since BTC can be burned on the Bitcoin blockchain by sending it to a dummy address.</p>

<p>These dummy addresses are the sorts of addresses that you’ve accidentally transferred funds to when you are still a crypto novice.</p>

<p>An Ethereum smart contract could watch the transactions being sent to these dummy Bitcoin addresses and mint an equivalent amount of BTC as ERC-20 tokens.</p>

<h2 id="-or-just-extend-the-supply">… OR JUST EXTEND THE SUPPLY?</h2>

<p>There is one last solution on the table and that’s to increase the supply of BTC.</p>

<p>21 million was a protocol defined limit, right?</p>

<p>However, it is technically possible to increase this limit so long, as there is consensus from the <strong>economic majority</strong> and no, that’s not just 51% of miners.</p>

<p>That includes all economic participants - miners, developers, users, merchants, the whole BTC gang.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/35.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The overwhelming majority of these groups have to be in agreement about any significant change to the Bitcoin network for it to pass.</p>

<p>Even though it’s ultimately the developers at companies like Blockstream, that implement the changes to Bitcoin’s code.</p>

<h2 id="example-why---a-story-of-bitcoin-cash">EXAMPLE WHY - A STORY OF BITCOIN CASH</h2>

<p>If you’re wondering why, consider the following.</p>

<p>Part of the Bitcoin community wanted to increase Bitcoin’s block size to accommodate more transactions.</p>

<p>Not everyone was on board with the idea.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/36.PNG" />
</center>

<p>This resulted in a fork of the Bitcoin network in the summer of 2017.</p>

<p>The new Bitcoin blockchain, with the larger block size, became known as Bitcoin Cash.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/btccollapse/37.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Now, Bitcoin Cash actually forked again in november 2018 to spawn Bitcoin Satoshi Vision aka Bitcoin SV.</p>

<h2 id="maybe-a-new-bitcoin-will-be-born">MAYBE A NEW BITCOIN WILL BE BORN..?</h2>

<p>Anyways, even though the economic stakeholders in Bitcoin’s ecosystem, that we see today, would never designate a Bitcoin blockchain with a higher BTC supply as the real Bitcoin, this could potentially change in the coming years and decades.</p>

<p>It is entirely possible, that the maximum supply of BTC could someday be increased.</p>

<h2 id="so-there-are-many-ways-for-btc-to-survive">SO THERE ARE MANY WAYS FOR BTC TO SURVIVE</h2>

<p>As it turns out, Bitcoin has more than one way of surviving well past the day those BTC mining rewards run out.</p>

<p>It’s crazy, that this will probably happen in our lifetime.</p>

<p>But probably the advancements we’re going to see in the cryptocurrency space, between now, and then, are going to be even crazier.</p>

<p>After all, the crypto space isn’t the only place where innovation is happening.</p>

<h2 id="all-the-hope-in-investors">ALL THE HOPE IN INVESTORS</h2>

<p>Many of these new inventions are going to be relevant to the Bitcoin network, and could potentially make it possible to create an entirely new economic model for cryptocurrency mining.</p>

<p><strong>This is going to be necessary, because  the Bitcoin network could not sustain itself on transaction fees alone, and it’s unlikely that layer 2 solutions will help at all with that issue.</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to payments, there is no shortage of competition in the cryptocurrency space, and sadly many of these competing projects do a much better job than Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is a great store of value, and public and private institutions are starting to see the light too.</p>

<p>It would not be surprising, if we see a major city state or government list BTC among its reserve assets by the end of this year.</p>

<p>Even when that news comes out, it will be the final confirmation, that the Bitcoin network is here to stay.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, it seems that BTC coins are slowly, but surely, migrating to greener pastures.</p>

<h2 id="what-most-likely-is-going-to-happen">WHAT MOST LIKELY IS GOING TO HAPPEN</h2>

<p>I think it is very likely that the majority of all existing BTC will be locked on smart contract blockchains, like Ethereum, Polkadot and Cardano by the end of the decade.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, everything revolves around economic incentives, and it’s logical, that people want to move their store of value assets to platforms, where they can earn interest.</p>

<p>Now, as for increasing the maximum supply of BTC, that is just completely out of the question.</p>

<p>For the time being Bitcoin is the most secure network in the world.</p>

<p>It has millions of users, millions of miners, and tens of thousands of the world’s brightest minds working on it day and night.</p>

<p>No amount of fun can change this fact.</p>
