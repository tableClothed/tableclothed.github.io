    <h5 id="deflation-in-japan">DEFLATION IN JAPAN</h5>

<p>The risk of inflation in March of last year was worrying.</p>

<p>The excess monetary stimulus, that was being thrown at the markets, and the impact that this would have, once the lockdowns eased was concerning.</p>

<p>Some said that inflation concerns were misguided, that deflation was the more likely scenario.</p>

<p>That’s not something to blame.</p>

<p>This was the main narrative, that was coming from the FED.</p>

<p>They were really concerned about a Japanese-style deflationary and stagnating economy, hence the reason that they flooded the system with money.</p>

<h5 id="printing-money-and-plans-to-keep-the-inflation-at-2">PRINTING MONEY AND PLANS TO KEEP THE INFLATION AT 2%</h5>

<p>However, that was a year ago, and things have progressed at a lightning pace.</p>

<p>Money printing continued through the rest of the year, as countries tried to stave off incoming second and third waves.</p>

<p>However, as vaccines started to roll out, and lockdowns were slowly being lifted, things began to change.</p>

<p>The FED was hoping to keep the market tethered to its inflation average target of below 2%.</p>

<p>Paul and CO said, that they didn’t have any fears of inflation, and as such, would not be tightening monetary policy anytime soon.</p>

<h5 id="commodities-and-price-rises">COMMODITIES AND PRICE RISES</h5>

<p>This was despite some of the warning signs. that were coming through the data commodity.</p>

<p>Prices were starting to surge across the board.</p>

<p>For example, this tweet from Dan Held.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Back in April those were the price increases, that we were seeing for some of these commodities.</p>

<p>As we know, commodities are used as raw materials for other goods and services.</p>

<p>It was inevitable, that we would start to see these price increases work their way through the rest of the economy.</p>

<p>Fuel prices have been on the rise since the beginning of the year, and house prices have been skyrocketing a combination of demand and lumber shortages.</p>

<p>So inflation was already beginning to rear its ugly head, and there were many market participants, who were beginning to ring the alarm bells.</p>

<h5 id="the-surprising-outcome---inflation">THE “SURPRISING” OUTCOME - INFLATION</h5>

<p>Then came the April CPI numbers, which were released 2 weeks ago.</p>

<p>They showed, that consumer prices had increased by 4.2% in the 12 months from April 2020.</p>

<p>That’s a full 2.2% above the FED target and even higher, than some economists were predicting.</p>

<p>It was also the highest CPI print since 2009.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it took the market by surprise, and led to a jump in long-term bond yields, and a fall in stock and crypto prices.</p>

<h5 id="ppi---producer-price-inflation">PPI - PRODUCER PRICE INFLATION</h5>

<p>Things didn’t get that much better, when a day later the US PPI numbers came in.</p>

<p><strong>Producer Price Inflation is a measure of the prices, that companies pay for the inputs of the goods, that they use in their production.</strong></p>

<p>These were up over 6.2% in April, and it was the largest increase in the PPI measure, since they started tracking it back in 2010.</p>

<p>There was also a 0.6% increase in the PPI in just one month from March.</p>

<p>So irrespective of how you slice or dice it, the inflation numbers were not looking good, and I’m sure, that the folks over at the FED were also starting to feel the heat.</p>

<p><strong>What did they expect, when they printed 25% of all the money ever in existence in a single year?</strong></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="why-inflation-is-deadly">WHY INFLATION IS DEADLY</h5>

<p>Anyways, there are a number of reasons, as to why inflation is so deadly, and I’m not even talking about the hyperinflation, that you see.</p>

<p><strong>In failed states inflation is the general increase in the price of goods and services.</strong></p>

<p>In a country it’s a broad measure of how much the cost of living has increased over time.</p>

<p>An increase in prices is not terrible, as long as it’s measured and in line with expectations, as well as increasing incomes.</p>

<p>However, when it is running above expectations, then it can lead to further inflation, as people increase their prices to match their expectations.</p>

<p>Persistent and high inflation is also detrimental to savers, as it means that the dollars, that they hold in their bank account are worth less today, than they were a year ago.</p>

<h5 id="inflation-and-investors">INFLATION AND INVESTORS</h5>

<p>And it’s not just individuals, that suffer the impact of higher inflation.</p>

<p>Think about all those institutional investors, that have to try and get an attractive real rate of return on their funds.</p>

<p>With a higher rate of inflation their dollar-denominated returns are less.</p>

<p>Or how about corporates?</p>

<p>When a corporate keeps cash on its balance sheet in order to fund its treasury management activities, that cash is depreciating at the rate of inflation.</p>

<p>This is a destruction of shareholder value, and means, that these companies will have fewer funds to invest in operations in the future.</p>

<p>In fact, it could be worse for corporate balance sheets than consumers.</p>

<h5 id="cpi-consumption">CPI CONSUMPTION</h5>

<p>Now, as I mentioned earlier, PPI, which is a production measure, was running hotter than CPI consumption.</p>

<p>The cost of inputs for companies is running higher, which means, that dollars saved on balance sheets, are worth that much less.</p>

<h5 id="impact-on-the-us-dollar">IMPACT ON THE US DOLLAR</h5>

<p>But that’s not even the worst part about inflation.</p>

<p>You have to consider the impact, that it has on the US dollar.</p>

<p>More broadly, the US dollar is the world’s reserve currency, which means, that a great deal of it is held offshore.</p>

<p>Fun fact, it’s estimated, that between 40-70% of all US dollar bank notes in circulation, are held outside of US borders.</p>

<p>Then of course, you have all those foreign central banks, that don’t only hold US dollars, but also dollar denominated debt.</p>

<p>The more value that the dollar loses each year, the more likely these central banks and foreign holders are to diversify their currency risk.</p>

<p>Of course, any selling by offshore holders devalues the US dollar relative to other currencies.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Take a look at this chart here.</p>

<p>It shows the US dollar index over the past month.</p>

<p>As you can see, it’s been trending down recently, and is near the lowest levels, that we’ve seen this year.</p>

<p>When the US dollar devalues relative to other currencies, it also makes the cost of imports that much more expensive, which of course adds to the inflation equation.</p>

<p>The point is that inflation is toxic and should be avoided.</p>

<p>It’s also one of those things, that are hard to reign back in again.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="cpi-inflation---cpi-basket">CPI INFLATION - CPI BASKET</h5>

<p>Once the genie is out of the bottle, and there is a strong case to be made, that the CPI inflation itself is vastly underestimating the true inflation.</p>

<p><strong>The main point of contention here comes down to the basket of goods and services used to measure the CPI.</strong></p>

<p>Basically the CPI measure is under counting inflation, because of the fact that the bureau of labor statistics adjusts the composition of the goods and services in that basket between two time periods.</p>

<p>Instead of looking at the price of the same goods and services between the two periods, it accounts for substitution and quality changes.</p>

<p>It assumes that consumers adjust behavior, and hence it means, that the composition of the basket has to change.</p>

<p>The main point to take away from this is that, they are not really comparing apples with apples, and it’s not only that you should consider.</p>

<h5 id="what-did-they-not-include-in-their-reports---pandemic-outcome">WHAT DID THEY NOT INCLUDE IN THEIR REPORTS - PANDEMIC OUTCOME</h5>

<p><strong>The fact that the basket used to determine this CPI does not include assets such as investment assets.</strong></p>

<p><strong>It does not include housing prices, even though these play a large part in the cost of living conundrum.</strong></p>

<p>I, of course, don’t need to tell you about how quickly the cost of housing has been going up recently.</p>

<p>Then you have to consider, how much consumption patterns have changed in the wake of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Think about what was purchased, and what was not.</p>

<p>In the wake of the lockdowns travel and leisure completely collapsed.</p>

<p>The only items, that people spent more on, were groceries and booze, both of which make sense.</p>

<p>In the words of IMF economist Marshall Reinstorf “<em>Spending patterns changed abruptly, and the CPI weight suddenly became obsolete.”</em></p>

<p>Apart from this, most shopping went online, where the price fluctuation can be a lot more rapid and volatile.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="incorrect-data">INCORRECT DATA</h5>

<p>Not only that, but because of this, shift data collection of the prices of goods services in the basket was hard to do.</p>

<p>Researchers could not visit physical stores in order to gather that price data.</p>

<p>So this means that the cost of living over the past year has been much higher, than we’re being led to believe based on the CPI data.</p>

<p>One more interesting chart, that you can look at, is this one by economist Alberto Cavall, which shows a different covert basket, which is running considerably hotter than the actual CPI basket.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Of course, I don’t think we need a CPI measure to tell us, how much prices have gone up over the past year, and what’s even more disconcerting about all of this is the fact, that most employers determine salary increases based on these official figures.</p>

<h5 id="how-to-protect-ourselves-from-inflation---invest-in-things-of-limited-supply">HOW TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM INFLATION? - INVEST IN THINGS OF LIMITED SUPPLY</h5>

<p>So, it’s quite clear, that inflation is a massive problem, and one that we could be under counting this then begs a very important question.</p>

<p>How do you protect yourself from this upcoming inflation?</p>

<p>The best hedges against inflation are those, that have a limited supply.</p>

<p>Those, that cannot easily be devalued by increasing the amount of supply in circulation.</p>

<p>Traditionally, these have been hard assets, like gold, which are perceived to have a limited supply, as well as fundamental use cases, as in jewellery, etc.</p>

<h5 id="gold-should-be-the-saltvation-but-there-was-no-hedge">GOLD SHOULD BE THE SALTVATION. BUT THERE WAS NO HEDGE..?</h5>

<p>However, if we take a look at the performance of gold over the past year, it’s been relatively meager.</p>

<p>Now, you would have thought, that the world’s premier reserve asset would have been breaking new all-time highs this year.</p>

<p>This has not been the case, but there is another inflation hedge, that has been doing just that, and that is of course Bitcoin.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="bitcoin---limited-supply">BITCOIN - LIMITED SUPPLY</h5>

<p>The reason that Bitcoin is seen as such an effective inflation hedge, is because of the fact, that it has a hard defined limit of 21 million.</p>

<p>There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin mined.</p>

<p>Fun fact, there are currently 51 million dollar millionaires in the world, so if each of them wanted some Bitcoin, there is not enough to go around for each to even have half a Bitcoin.</p>

<p>This is not even counting the fact, that at least 20% of Bitcoin has been lost forever.</p>

<h5 id="decreasing-emission-schedule">DECREASING EMISSION SCHEDULE</h5>

<p>Another supply factor, that you have to consider is the fact, that Bitcoin has a decreasing emission schedule.</p>

<p>Its inflation rate keeps on falling and approaches 0 over time.</p>

<p>Now, of course there are many more qualities, that make Bitcoin more favorable to gold as an asset to store wealth.</p>

<p>And it’s not just me, that is saying this.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin inflation hedge trade has been taken on by numerous institutional investors.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="investors-that-converted-to-bitcoin-cult">INVESTORS THAT CONVERTED TO BITCOIN CULT</h5>

<p>For example, one of the most prolific global macro investors is Paul Tudor Jones, and last year he wrote this paper on the great monetary inflation quite simply.</p>

<p>It talked about the impact, that money printing would have on asset markets, and why he was investing in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>You also have the likes of Stanley Druckenmiller, one of the most well-known Forex traders in the world.</p>

<p>He was also raising the alarm bells around this incoming USD inflation, and the implications, this could have on the Bitcoin markets.</p>

<p>He even went a step further and claimed, that cryptocurrency like Bitcoin could one day replace the US dollar as a global reserve asset.</p>

<p>Or how about Bill Miller, the storied value investor behind the Leg Mason Opportunity fund?</p>

<p>He basically pointed out in a Q4 market update, that if inflation were to pick up, then corporates would be allocating a larger proportion of their balance sheet towards Bitcoin.</p>

<p>“<em>Trickle would turn into a torrent, and that trickle has already started</em>”.</p>

<h5 id="companies-that-invested-in-btc">COMPANIES THAT INVESTED IN BTC</h5>

<p>We know of a number of companies, that have been allocating a portion of their treasury positions towards Bitcoin.</p>

<p>These of course include the likes of Microstrategy, Square, Tesla, MeToo and Acre, to name but a few.</p>

<p>Now, these companies all allocated to Bitcoin, as they were worried about the impact, that the inflation would have on their long-term shareholder value, and as Bill Miller stated, this trickle is likely to become a Torrent.</p>

<p>That is because of the sheer number of companies, that are concerned about the impact of inflation.</p>

<p>Take a look at this chart.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>It shows, the percentage increase in the average mentions of the word “<em>inflation</em>” by 26 S&amp;P 500 companies in their earnings calls.</p>

<p>Clearly, the concern is on their mind, and this was even before we had those high CPI and PPI prints 2 weeks ago.</p>

<p>You can bet your bottom dollar, that these will be up yet again in the next round of earnings calls.</p>

<h4 id="why-bitcoin-fell">WHY BITCOIN FELL?</h4>

<p>We know, that Bitcoin is seen as a premier inflation hedge.</p>

<p>This then begs a very important question.</p>

<p>Why did it fall the day of that CPI print?</p>

<p>Surely, it should have rallied.</p>

<p>There is a lot more going on here.</p>

<h5 id="fed-comes-in-and-increases-interest-rates">FED COMES IN AND INCREASES INTEREST RATES</h5>

<p>When the CPI prints came in 2 weeks ago and took the markets by surprise, the main concern was not really the actual inflation itself, but what it meant for interest rates.</p>

<p>You see, the market is aware of the fact, that the FED has a set inflation target of 2% earlier this year.</p>

<p>The FED was giving guidance that it would not be loosening monetary policy this year.</p>

<p>In fact, the FED was hoping to keep the average inflation below the percent target until at least 2023.</p>

<p>Therefore, with such a high print above the inflation target, it means, that the FED has had its hand forced.</p>

<p>It will need to increase interest rates in order to rein back in that money and stop the economy from overheating.</p>

<p>Of course, higher interest rates have large implications.</p>

<p>For nearly every asset class out there, including Bitcoin, we actually saw this more recently, when the secretary of the treasury caused an interest rate scare with her comments about monetary tightening.</p>

<h5 id="correlation-between-fund-rate-and-btc">CORRELATION BETWEEN FUND RATE AND BTC</h5>

<p>Why does a higher FED’s fund rate impact on Bitcoin?</p>

<p>This is because despite Bitcoin being a long-term hedge for inflation, it is still viewed as a risk-on asset.</p>

<p>These are assets, that are generally riskier, and which investors are happy to allocate their funds to in a low rates environment assets that are more risk-off, include bonds and cash.</p>

<p>These of course yield much more when rates go up.</p>

<p>I should also point out, that when rates go up, the discount rate used to calculate future cash flows goes up, which means a lower present stock value.</p>

<p>But that is neither here nor there.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="because-its-a-risky-asset---investors-stick-to-smth-safer">BECAUSE ITS A RISKY ASSET - INVESTORS STICK TO SMTH SAFER</h5>

<p>The point is that, in an environment with rising rates, risk on assets tend to underperform.</p>

<p>Given that Bitcoin is seen as one of the riskiest assets in the risky bucket, it will naturally also suffer from this.</p>

<p>There is statistical evidence.</p>

<p>Here you only need to take a look at the correlation between the price of equities and crypto.</p>

<p>Last year in 2020 we had the highest correlation between the two factors since data has been tracked.</p>

<p>Take a look at this report by the chaps over at Van Eck.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>As you can see from this analysis, there was almost no correlation between them in the years prior, whereas last year it was statistically significant.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Here you can see another chart, that shows the correlation as a graph.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Over time it’s a clear uptrend from mildly negative in 2017, to moderately positive this year.</p>

<h5 id="not-hedge-for-stock-market-volatility">NOT HEDGE FOR STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY</h5>

<p>From all the available evidence, it appears that Bitcoin is not really a hedge for stock market volatility.</p>

<p>It is placed in the same bucket, and will hence rise and fall.</p>

<h5 id="correlated-with-stocks---hence-sensitive-to-interest-rate">CORRELATED WITH STOCKS - HENCE SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATE</h5>

<p>Bitcoin is correlated with stocks, and is hence sensitive to interest rate hikes.</p>

<p>However, inflation is much more pervasive, and unlike the FED’s fund rate, it is hard as hell to control.</p>

<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is not a cash flow based asset like stocks.</p>

<p>It’s an asset, that has completely different characteristics and use cases.</p>

<p>Its correlation to stocks is more of a short-term phenomenon, as these institutional investors adjust their portfolios.</p>

<p>It’s unlikely to be a long-term trend, and as such, I happen to think, that Bitcoin will become less responsive to rate hike fears, just the way it was intended.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h4>

<p>Last year in response to the pandemic governments seem to have thrown the baby out with the bath water, and that water is now flooding the streets leaving them awash with cash.</p>

<p>It’s even more worrying now, than it was last year, and if the recent cpi prints and stock route is anything to go by the fear has become real.</p>

<p>No, it’s not Venezuela or Zimbabwe levels of inflation, but it’s alarming for many of the reasons that were highlighted earlier.</p>

<p>These inflationary concerns are having two contradictory effects on the markets in the short term.</p>

<p>They’re causing panic because of the fears, that they could lead to a FED tapering.</p>

<p>The markets have become drunk on the free money, that has been raining down on them, and they are now worried, that the FED’s founding may slow to a trickle.</p>

<p>These fears have also led to a sell-off in Bitcoin, but this is likely to only be temporary.</p>

<p>The inflation narrative is likely to be that much more pervasive and last for quite some time.</p>

<p>This is because it’s a lot harder to rein it in without seriously damaging the economy.</p>

<p>In this climate, it will be hard for people companies and institutions to preserve their investments and purchasing power going forward.</p>

<p>Bitcoin really is the digital gold that they have been looking for.</p>

<p>Limited supply, decreasing inflation rate, easy to transport and store in the turbulent sea of rising prices, it really will be the lifeboat sent from above to rescue you from decreasing purchasing power.</p>

<p>All praise to Satoshi.</p>

    <time datetime="2021-08-01T16:10:35+01:00" class="post-date">01 Aug 2021</time>

    <h5 id="killer-project-that-could-get-many-people-into-crypto">KILLER PROJECT THAT COULD GET MANY PEOPLE INTO CRYPTO</h5>
<p>Have you been searching for that killer app, that has the potential to open the floodgates, and bring hundreds of millions of people into crypto?</p>

<p>Needless to say, that elusive unicorn would likely be valued at a pretty penny, which means, if you got into it at the right time, you could post some truly insane gains.</p>

<p>But what if that project combined NTFs, sports and crypto?</p>

<p>That’s the type of rocket fuel, that could send it to the stratosphere, right?</p>

<p>Well, if you’re nodding your head, then I think I found the project for you, and that would be Chiliz.</p>

<h5 id="tokenizing-the-sport-for-a-gray-mass">TOKENIZING THE SPORT FOR A GRAY MASS</h5>
<p>Chiliz chaps are all about tokenizing the sports and entertainment sectors by creating a fan engagement platform.</p>

<p>Sounds great, but why on Earth would you want to do that, in the first place?</p>

<p>Well, I’m sure everyone has at least a passing interest in sports. But here’s the deal:</p>

<h5 id="mere-fan-cant-make-a-decision-on-his-team-unless">MERE FAN CANT MAKE A DECISION ON HIS TEAM… UNLESS?</h5>

<p>Sports fans can only really watch their team, buy that merch, and buy overpriced match day pies.</p>

<p>So in essence, we’re all passive sports content consumers, and have no active influence over what happens with the team.</p>

<p>Maybe that’s a bit of a stretch.</p>

<p>Most <em>normal</em> people like are passive sports content consumers.</p>

<p>It is true, that if you’re a billionaire, like Sheikh Mansour, you might decide to buy a football team like Manchester City.</p>

<p>Do that, and then you can certainly influence the team.</p>

<p>But for mere future billionaires, there are almost no systems, in place to influence their team’s decisions, which is kind of annoying for fans, when their manager or coach makes some super silly decision.</p>

<p>Chiliz basically aims to solve that problem by giving fans a say in their team’s management, as well, as a new way to engage with their team.</p>

<h5 id="why-would-players-and-teams-agree-to-this---money">WHY WOULD PLAYERS AND TEAMS AGREE TO THIS? - MONEY</h5>

<p>It’s pretty cool, but why on Earth would a sports team want to give fans a say?</p>

<p>Surely there are a ton of highly paid bigwigs, that would be out of a job.</p>

<p>Well, the teams dictate the decisions that fans can influence, so some teams might not want to crowdsource that team sheet every day, and I can kind of understand that.</p>

<p>Now, like it or not, most sports teams out there are businesses, and that means they need to make money.</p>

<p>Those star players don’t tend to play for free after all.</p>

<p>Those key income streams would be TV rights deals, merchandise sales, and gate receipts.</p>

<p>Yes, it is true, that gate receipts have been a bit of a pickle for most sports teams over the last year.</p>

<p>However, a key way to further grow that team income, would be through opening up new ways to monetize those fans, and that’s the value proposition that Chiliz offers these sports teams, by allowing them to sell fans the right to vote on specific team decisions.</p>

<p>A form of radical fan engagement if you will.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="win-win-for-fans-and-teams">WIN-WIN FOR FANS AND TEAMS</h5>

<p>Put simply, Chiliz offers the solution for teams to gamify team management, turn it into an entertainment proposition in its own right, and monetize the demand for these voting rights.</p>

<p>Fans on the other hand get a new way to support their team, and get given the opportunity to vote on certain team decisions, all of which impact on real world sporting events.</p>

<p>So that’s a win for the team, and for the fans, who like the idea of that opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="chiliz-ecosystem">CHILIZ ECOSYSTEM</h3>
<h5 id="socioscom-app-and-fan-tokens">SOCIOS.COM APP AND FAN TOKENS</h5>

<p>There are two key platforms that make up Chiliz.</p>

<p>The first would be <em>socios.com</em>, which is that team crowd management platform.</p>

<p>This empowers fans to take an active role in guiding various decisions, and have an influence on events for their favorite sports teams.</p>

<p>That’s all made possible by blockchain-based Fan Tokens, which allowed for secure and trustless deployment of tokenized voting rights, all executed by smart contracts on the <em>socios</em> platform.</p>

<p>So, on the <em>socios</em> app you might want to buy a Fan Token for Juventus Football Club, which would give you voting rights for certain club decisions.</p>

<p>However, those Fan Tokens also act a bit like loyalty cards, by giving you access to merchandise discounts and unique experiences.</p>

<p>That could include things like exclusive dugout access on matchdays, or getting your hands on a signed shirt from your sporting hero.</p>

<p>What’s also important to note, is that, every sports team listed on the app has its own unique Fan Token.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h3 id="socioscom---key-functionalities">SOCIOS.COM - KEY FUNCTIONALITIES</h3>

<p>Basically, the <em>socios</em> app has 7 key features active right now.</p>

<h5 id="1-buy-crypto">1. BUY CRYPTO</h5>

<p>The first is that, <strong>it acts as a type of fiat on-ramp into crypto</strong>.</p>

<p>You can buy Chiliz tokens via the app using Mastercard, Visa, Skrill and Rapid.</p>

<p>You’ll need those Chiliz tokens to get your hands on the Fan Tokens for your favorite team.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="2-buy-sell-fan-coins">2. BUY-SELL FAN COINS</h5>

<p>Next, there’s a trading section that allows you to buy and sell those Fan Tokens.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="3-voting">3. VOTING</h5>

<p>Then you have that all-important voting function for those that own Fan Tokens.</p>

<p><strong>This allows you to vote on things like shirt designs, the name for training grounds, and more.</strong></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Now, Cypriot first division side Apollon FC kind of took the concept of fan engagement to the next level.</p>

<p>In a friendly match against their rivals, the team sheet and formation were picked by their fans, using <em>socios</em>.</p>

<p>It turns out, that the fans clearly knew a thing or two with Apollon FC emerging as 6:0 victors in that match.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="4-rewards-for-holding-crypto---discounts-etc">4. REWARDS FOR HOLDING CRYPTO - DISCOUNTS, ETC</h5>

<p>Some of the current benefits you can access through the app, if you hold enough Fan Tokens, are things like a 20% discount on the merchandise from certain teams.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="5-earning-reward-tokens">5. EARNING REWARD TOKENS</h5>

<p>You can also earn reward tokens by engaging with the app, which you can redeem for exclusive club goodies.</p>

<h5 id="6-pokemon-go">6. POKEMON GO</h5>

<p>And more another neat game in the app is socios version of Pokemon Go.</p>

<p>In short, you can chase down those fan and Chiliz tokens in the real world via an augmented reality feature in the app.</p>

<p>Find those coins and you can get some of them for free.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="7-the-locker-room">7. THE LOCKER ROOM</h5>

<p>And finally, you can get access to something called the <strong>locker room</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ll cover this in a bit, when I get into the Chiliz tokens.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="supported-sports">SUPPORTED SPORTS</h5>

<p>In terms of supported sports on the app, right now the focus is on football.</p>

<p>However, some esports and basketball teams are involved with MMA coming soon too.</p>

<p>What’s interesting is that, this model of gamification can be replicated in almost any other sports vertical.</p>

<p>So the potential here is truly massive.</p>

<p>I’m thinking about sports like formula one, cricket, or the nfl. Yep, American football.</p>

<h5 id="second-elefment-of-chiliz-ecosystem---chiliz-exchange">SECOND ELEFMENT OF CHILIZ ECOSYSTEM - CHILIZ EXCHANGE</h5>

<p>Now, the second element of the Chiliz ecosystem would be the Chiliz exchange.</p>

<p>The main draw here is all the Fan Token trading pairs, which have CHZ trading pairs only.</p>

<p>Yes, there are a few other regular crypto trading pairs, like CHZ to USDT, or CHZ to BTC, but I’ll level with you, the main focus is on trading those Fan Tokens.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Also do note, that if you want to get your hands on some Chiliz or fans tokens, this is going to be the cheapest exchange to buy them.</p>

<p>Basically, if you’re using the CHZ trading pair to buy on the exchange, you’ll be paying 0% in fees.</p>

<p>Exchange fees to sell on CHZ trading pairs are 0.6%, with other pairs being charged at 0.2% in fees.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="what-teams-have-partnered-up-with-socios-so-far">WHAT TEAMS HAVE PARTNERED UP WITH SOCIOS SO FAR?</h5>

<p>Now, you’re probably wondering which teams have partnered up with <em>socios</em> so far.</p>

<p>No offense to Apollon FC, but I imagine most of you are not huge fans of Cypriot first division football.</p>

<p>So let’s take a look at some other teams to have signed up.</p>

<p>I know that many crypto veterans out there will be jaded by partnership announcements, which generally turn out to be nothing but hot air.</p>

<p>To be fair, there are still plenty of those happening in the crypto space today, so you could be forgiven for thinking that.</p>

<p>The idea of Chiliz partnering up with the likes of Barcelona, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Atletico, Madrid, and AC Milan is nothing but false promises.</p>

<p>However, those with a healthy dose of skepticism only need to look at these team’s social accounts, and you can find mentions of both Chiliz and <em>socios</em>.</p>

<p>These are some of the biggest football clubs in the world, with massive fan bases, and millions of twitter followers.</p>

<p>To be honest, I didn’t quite believe that these partnerships are real, when I first glanced over the project, but yes, everything really does seem to be an order there.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="chiliz-tokens">CHILIZ TOKENS</h5>

<p>Now, I know I’ve covered quite a lot, but I’ve not really got into the tokens yet.</p>

<p>First, you note that there are 4 types of Chiliz ecosystem tokens.</p>

<p>You have those Fan Tokens, which are issued for all sports teams partnering up with Chiliz on <em>socios</em>.</p>

<p>For each team a finite number of Fan Tokens are issued, with concrete voting rights, and the ability to unlock rewards and those perks I spoke about earlier.</p>

<p>Fans get those voting rights by swapping Chiliz tokens for Fan Tokens, to gain decision-making rights for that team.</p>

<p>So I might own a Juventus Fan Token, and that will only let me vote on Juventus related events.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>What’s super interesting here is that, these Fan Tokens have created yet another form of crypto backed fundraising - the <strong>Fan Token Offering (FTO)</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s how new partners are launched on the <em>socios.com</em> platform.</p>

<p>In short, a fixed price per Fan Token is agreed upon by <em>socios</em> and the team.</p>

<p>Then, a portion of the Fan Tokens are made available on the <em>socios</em> platform for fans to buy, and users can get them at a fixed price.</p>

<p>A bit like an ICO, IEO or IDO.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="tbf-tho-whats-the-demand-for-such-token">TBF THO, WHAT’S THE DEMAND FOR SUCH TOKEN?</h5>

<p>Now, there may be some of you that are probably doubting the demand for things like Fan Tokens.</p>

<p>Well, here’s an interesting fact.</p>

<p>A recent FTO by AC Milan generated more than 6 million dollars in the first 30 minutes of launch.</p>

<p>So yes, if that’s anything to go by, there is some pretty crazy demand for these tokens.</p>

<p>However this is not a one-off thing.</p>

<p>In 2021 Chiliz claims, that Fan Tokens generated over 30 million dollars in revenue for sports teams and partners via FTOs in 2022.</p>

<p>Pretty handy for teams suffering from those low gate receipts thanks to the pandemic.</p>

<h5 id="token-burningas-incentive">TOKEN BURNINGAS INCENTIVE</h5>

<p>Another important thing to note, is that earlier in the year Chiliz announced Fan Token burn mechanisms.</p>

<p>Essentially, the better the team performs, and the more Fan Token holders there are, the fewer tokens that will be in circulation.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>An example of that can be seen over here.</p>

<p>Let’s say, we hold the Barcelona Fan Tokens here.</p>

<p>20 000 of these Fan Tokens were burned per goal, and 40 000 were burned, if Barcelona won.</p>

<p>Yes, it is true, that football fans are maybe even more tribal, than the crypto community, and the demand for them seems to have been validated.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="tokenomics">TOKENOMICS</h5>

<p>But what about their tokenomics?</p>

<p>Well, what you need to be aware of is that, usually only a very small percentage of the total supply is circulating.</p>

<p>Take the Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token for example.</p>

<p>Just 6 of the 20 million total supply is circulating.</p>

<p>The rest of the tokens held by PSG Football Club have a linear vesting schedule of 8 years with 2.5 million being released per year.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s about double the current circulating supply.</p>

<p>That’s certainly something worth knowing, if you’re thinking about dabbling in PSG tokens.</p>

<p>I mean, there is going to be quite a bit of inflation.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>After all, the same is true of Juventus Fan Tokens with just 1.3 million tokens circulating with a total supply of 20 million.</p>

<p>The rest of those Fan Tokens have that same monthly linear vesting schedule of 8 years with 2.5 million youth tokens being released every year.</p>

<p>I think you get the picture here.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Now, many sports fans don’t know about the importance of tokenomics.</p>

<p>They are likely to just buy those tokens because they like a certain team.</p>

<p>I’m sure you have friends, who are likely to be in that category.</p>

<h5 id="inflation-and-demand">INFLATION AND DEMAND</h5>

<p>So, the main question for anyone looking at wading into the Fan Token waters should be <em>“Will demand for fan tokens outstrip their pretty crazy inflation rate?”</em>.</p>

<p>If that’s the case, then we can expect the token price to increase.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in checking out all the different Fan Tokens and their perspective market caps, then you might want to check out <em>fantokenrank.com</em>.</p>

<p>It’s basically like a <em>CoinMarketCap</em> for Fan Tokens only. Secondly you have the Chiliz or CHZ token.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s the one that went to the proverbial moon recently and grabbed most of the news headlines.</p>

<h5 id="pay-attention-with-buying">PAY ATTENTION WITH BUYING!</h5>

<p>What’s important to note though, is that, it’s both an ERC-20 utility token and a BEP-2 token on the Binance Chain, so be sure not to mix things up, if you’re depositing or withdrawing from an exchange.</p>

<p>CHZ tokens are basically used as the fuel for the Chiliz ecosystem, and are used by fans to acquire those all-important Fan Tokens for any of the teams partnered with <em>socios.com</em>.</p>

<p>The way, I think of them, is that they act in a similar way to ETH back in those crazy ICO days of 2017, except they’re for Fan Token Offerings.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="potential-future-plans-to-increase-demand">POTENTIAL FUTURE PLANS TO INCREASE DEMAND</h5>

<p>The next use case of the CHZ token hasn’t gone live yet, however, in the near future MMA fans will be able to buy UFC tickets with Chiliz tokens.</p>

<p>Chiliz will also be giving out VIP experiences for specific UFC events.</p>

<p>Those sorts of unique experiences could lead to an increase in demand for CHZ tokens.</p>

<p>Now, if you’d like me to speculate a bit here, I don’t think it would be outlandish to think, that Chiliz will expand similar options to sports teams partnered with the platform.</p>

<p>It’s also true, that CHZ can be used as a store, and transfer of value like every other cryptocurrency and they can be traded on exchanges.</p>

<p>So now that you know about the core demand drivers for the Chiliz token, what do you need to know about the supply side of the equation?</p>

<h5 id="tokenomics-of-che">TOKENOMICS OF CHE</h5>

<p>Well, honestly, I have not been able to find any more recent information on the tokenomics, so we’ll have to use the outline from a year ago.</p>

<p>That outlines that 20 of net trading fees on the Chiliz exchange will be burned, so will 10 of the net proceeds from FTOs and 20 of the proceeds from NFTs and collectibles.</p>

<p>That announcement for version 2.0 of Chiliz token economics states, that those terms for burning CHZ are valid till June 2020, when they’ll be reviewed.</p>

<p>Sadly, I’ve not been able to find more recent information on that.</p>

<p>However, Chiliz did tweet earlier in 2021 that the first burn of the year was based on that token economics announcement, and that 11 million CHZ tokens had been sent to the incinerator.</p>

<p>That token burn was worth around 5.5 million dollars at the time of shooting this video.</p>

<p>Not too large an amount, given that the project commands a market cap of just over 2.5 billion.</p>

<p>However, what I like about this token burn method is that, it reminds me of Binance’s BNB token burns, those burns being directly linked to platform use.</p>

<h5 id="the-locker-room-tokens">THE LOCKER ROOM TOKENS</h5>

<p>The third type of Chiliz token would be <strong>Locker Tokens</strong>.</p>

<p>So what are those?</p>

<p>Well, in the <em>socios</em> app there’s a feature, I glossed over earlier called <em>the Socios Locker Room</em>.</p>

<p>Its purpose is to show potential partner clubs, how much demand there is for their team’s Fan Tokens.</p>

<p>So yes, it’s basically <em>socios</em> users saying “*Hey, Mr. Sports Club, we really want you to do a Fan Token with socios”.</p>

<p>Those chaps at <em>socios</em> create a locker for each potential partner club.</p>

<p>These are open for 120 days.</p>

<p>Users can put CHZ tokens into the locker, and you get Locker Tokens in return.</p>

<p>If the partner decides to launch a Fan Token, then these Locker Tokens are swapped for official Fan Tokens at a rate of one to one.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="whats-the-profit">WHAT’S THE PROFIT?</h5>

<p>But why bother with this? What’s the incentive?</p>

<p>Well, if a potential partner doesn’t opt to launch their Fan Token in the specified time period, then you get your CHZ tokens back.</p>

<p>However, if the club does go ahead with that, you’ve secured your allocation of Fan Tokens, and you get 10% of the money you initially invested in.</p>

<p>Bonus CHZ cashback.</p>

<p>The interesting side effect of this Locker Room mechanic is that, it essentially replicates staking by taking CHZ tokens off the open market, and reducing the tradable supply.</p>

<p>So yes, yet another use case for CHZ.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="erc-1155-token---for-unique-tokens">ERC 1155 TOKEN - FOR UNIQUE TOKENS</h5>

<p>The final type of token in the Chiliz ecosystem, would be the ERC-1155 NFTs.</p>

<p>Basically <em>socios</em> teamed up with engine to create Ethereum based collectibles for partner clubs.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, Chiliz also announced it had integrated with Chainlink to mint NFTs in real time.</p>

<p>So why is that a big deal?</p>

<p>Well, it allows Chiliz to create dynamic NFTs in response to real world sporting events and mint limited edition NFTs.</p>

<p>For example, if a player scores their 100th goal then limited edition NFTs might be minted to commemorate it.</p>

<p>You also have the likes of Paris Saint-Germain tweeting about <em>socios</em> NFTs too, and here’s AC Milan letting their fans know, that they should get ready for AC Milan NFT collectibles.</p>

<h5 id="chiliz---rewards-tied-with-ntfs">CHILIZ - REWARDS TIED WITH NTFS</h5>

<p>Honestly, when it comes to NFTs and sport, it all makes a ton of sense to me.</p>

<p>I mean, think about the crazy money that sports fans are willing to pay for collectibles, like memorabilia and sports cards.</p>

<p>But what really sets Chiliz apart from others in the NFT space is that, they understand that NFTs need to have value, if prices are going to be supported long term.</p>

<p>At the moment, they are focused on rewards.</p>

<p>So an example of that would be the ownership of a specific Juventus NFT could lead to being granted exclusive access to a VIP box at the stadium.</p>

<p>What’s even more exciting is that, I can see how those types of NFTs could really appeal to no coiner sports fans too.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="worth-the-hype">WORTH THE HYPE?</h5>

<p>So what do I think about these tokens?</p>

<p>Well, honestly, I find Fan Tokens really hard to value, and that’s because sports fans can really be quite irrational, when it comes to their teams.</p>

<p>I know guys, that would spend over a thousand of the queen’s finest pounds and days traveling to away games in far-flung places.</p>

<p>This even though their team frankly has little hope of winning.</p>

<p>When you have fans behaving so emotionally, it’s honestly very difficult to gauge your value for these token types.</p>

<p>With the CHZ token, I think in the medium to long term that it’s very simple.</p>

<p>If the platform does well, so will the token.</p>

<p>But I would urge people to be careful, and think about their entry point, if they’re considering getting some CHZ.</p>

<p>At the time of shooting this video, there was a large pullback, but prices are still well off those, seen before it went parabolic.</p>

<p>Locker Tokens do seem like a good way to give yourself a chance of making a better return on the CHZ, if you have that hanging around, or you’d be interested in getting exposure to a certain Fan Token, if it was launched.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="partnerships-binance-potential-rewards">PARTNERSHIPS, BINANCE, POTENTIAL REWARDS</h5>

<p>Finally, on the Chiliz NFT front.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think it all depends on the perks, that can be unlocked by holding these NFTs.</p>

<p>If they unlock great exclusive rewards, or unique experiences, that fans really want, then I have no doubt, that they’ll command sky high prices.</p>

<p>Imagine the demand for an NFT amongst football fans, that allowed you to meet up with Lionel Messi once a year.</p>

<p>I imagine that every fan and football youtuber under the sun would want a piece of that one.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="partneships">PARTNESHIPS</h5>

<p>But what about Chiliz partnerships?</p>

<p>Well, there is a very important one, that I want to go over quickly.</p>

<p>Binance is both a partner and investor in Chiliz.</p>

<p>That’s why almost every Fan Token and the CHZ token is listed on Binance.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>It also gave access to certain Fan Tokens, like PSG and you’ve on the Binance launch pool.</p>

<p>If liquidity is something that concerns you, then honestly I would opt to trade them on Binance every day of the week.</p>

<p>That trade volume and liquidity is typically way better, than the Chiliz exchange itself.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Probably not a surprise to anyone out there, also Binance frankly offers way more trading pairs.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="fans-are-good-customers">FANS ARE GOOD CUSTOMERS</h5>

<p>Honestly, I know firsthand, how passionate sports fans can be.</p>

<p>I wonder, if fan tokens could end up becoming a bit like how diamonds are.</p>

<p>More or bigger diamonds equals more love or, in terms of Fan Tokens, that would be more Fan Tokens, the bigger a supporter you really are.</p>

<p>Let’s face it, there are billions of sports fans out there in the world, and almost everyone I know seems to love the idea of being able to influence their team’s decisions and get exclusive perks.</p>

<p>Overall, I really like Chiliz as a project, the concept, and how they’re seemingly paving the way for unique digital sports memorabilia with NFTs in real time.</p>

<p>I also really love the idea of attaching tangible team-related perks to NFTs.</p>

<p>That way they have tangible real-world value, and this should drive future demand.</p>

<p>Now, that I think about it, there are plenty of countries in the world, where gambling on sports is illegal.</p>

<p>Think of the likes of China, where folks are football crazy.</p>

<p>What Fan Tokens also allow people to do, is to speculate on the success of teams.</p>

<p>Due to that, Fan Token burn mechanism, and how in theory teams should be more popular the more they win.</p>

<p>In a way, it’s kind of like an indirect way of betting on them too.</p>

<h5 id="expanding---how-crazy-would-that-be">EXPANDING - HOW CRAZY WOULD THAT BE?</h5>

<p>There are billions of sports fans around the world.</p>

<p>Yes, the majority are probably not Die Hard fans, but I’d wager that hundreds of millions are, and would be open to using a platform like <em>socios</em>.</p>

<p>That’s a heck of a lot of new people, who could be introduced to the world of crypto, and I guess that’s what makes Chiliz so intriguing as a platform.</p>

<p>Also think about this potential to add more teams and sports.</p>

<p>I also hear, that Chiliz plans on expanding into the US with a 50 million dollar investment.</p>

<p>Just think how crazy that could be, if they got some big NF1 teams onto the platform.</p>

<p>But with all that being said, I do believe that Chiliz long-term success rests on voting power, and rewards, that fans really care about.</p>

<p>In a crazy world, where anything seems possible, is it really so far-fetched to think that even major decisions, like transfers team sheets and formations, could be decided by fans in the future.</p>

<p>I imagine that’s something almost every sports fan would be interested in.</p>

<p>The one thing, I am wary of at the time of shooting the video, is the market cap valuations of these tokens.</p>

<p>Is Chiliz really worth close to three billion dollars?</p>

<p>I’ll let you decide now.</p>

    <time datetime="2021-08-01T16:10:35+01:00" class="post-date">01 Aug 2021</time>

    <h5 id="intro">INTRO</h5>

<p>If you’re a hardcore cryptocurrency hodler you’ve probably seen many price pumps and dumps come and go.</p>

<p>At some point you’ve probably looked yourself in the mirror and asked why you didn’t sell the top and buy the dip.</p>

<p>After all, the crypto market ebbs and flows, right?</p>

<p>That’s what seasoned cryptocurrency traders believe, and capitalizing on these short-term patterns is what has made many of them so successful.</p>

<p><strong>For the average crypto connoisseur, however, hodling will provide the same profits or more than if they had actively traded.</strong></p>

<p>This is because cryptocurrency trading is hard, and the technical analysis required to do it effectively takes a lot of time, a lot of practice, and a lot of patience to master.</p>

<p>Technical trading looks incredibly arbitrary.</p>

<p>Just pull up trading view, draw a few lines number go up, and boom, you’re Warren Buffett Jr.</p>

<p>Of course, whenever you try doing this, you just get bogged.</p>

<p>Surely, there is more to technical analysis, than drawing a bunch of lines, and hoping for the best.</p>

<h5 id="history-of-japanese-rice-trader">HISTORY OF JAPANESE RICE TRADER</h5>

<p>As it turns out, technical analysis actually has some solid science behind it, and has existed for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>The candlestick chart, that comes to mind, when you think of trading, is said to have been invented by a japanese rice merchant named Honma Monehisa almost 300 years ago/</p>

<p>So, if you’re a weeb, you have no excuses not to learn technical market analysis/</p>

<p>Honma wrote what is believed to be the first book on market psychology, which details many of the patterns and terminologies expert traders continue to use to this day.</p>

<p>He’s believed to be the most successful trader, who ever lived, reportedly banging over 10 billion in today’s dollars over the course of his trading career.</p>

<p>That’s not so hard to believe, considering that he was probably the only person on the planet at the time, who had an in-depth understanding of the ebb and flow of commodity markets.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t just Honma’s first mover status, that made his trading so successful.</p>

<h5 id="human-psychology-is-the-critical-factor">HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY IS THE CRITICAL FACTOR</h5>

<p>It was his understanding, that human psychology is what fundamentally moves any given market.</p>

<p>Emotions like fear and greed follow surprisingly consistent patterns, and with the right analysis, these patterns can not only be easily seen on a candlestick chart, they can also be predicted/</p>

<h5 id="other-factors-worth-keeping-in-mind">OTHER FACTORS WORTH KEEPING IN MIND</h5>

<p>It is important to keep in mind, that although technical analysis has proven itself to be a powerful trading tool, there are other factors you should keep in mind, when it comes to crafting a trading strategy for cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>This includes things like tokenomics, network activity, use case, the team behind the cryptocurrency, any notable partnerships it has, and even macro indicators, like Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow model, and Bitcoin dominance.</p>

<p>Evaluating these factors is called <strong>fundamental analysis</strong>, because it focuses on more objective measures of an asset’s potential value.</p>

<p>If you’re a hodler, these are probably the metrics you’re using to decide on which cryptocurrency to invest in, and when to sell it.</p>

<h5 id="fundamental-analysis-vs-technical-analysis">FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS VS TECHNICAL ANALYSIS</h5>

<p>In contrast to fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses almost exclusively on price action.</p>

<p>Pumps and dumps are ultimately caused by the irrational emotions of the people holding an asset, fundamentals be damned.</p>

<p>Some would argue, that technical analysis is the more accurate way to trade cryptocurrencies, given that the average cryptocurrency holder is exponentially more irrational, than suit and tie wall street investors.</p>

<p>Given all the insane price action around food themed DeFi tokens and WIFI token clones, I think there’s a case to be made there.</p>

<p>However, each cryptocurrency will require its own special blend of fundamental analysis and technical analysis in its price projections.</p>

<p>It will be up to you to figure out, how much emphasis you should be putting on one versus the other.</p>

<p>Most of this will be determined by how long you plan to hold that cryptocurrency for.</p>

<p><strong>As a rule of thumb, technical analysis is used for shorter term trading, and fundamental analysis is used for longer term trading and hodling.</strong></p>

<p>If you really want to be a crypto king or queen, you’ll need to learn how to do both.</p>

<h5 id="trading-pairs-as-an-indicatpr-of-performance">TRADING PAIRS AS AN INDICATPR OF PERFORMANCE</h5>

<p>You should also remember that although stablecoin trading pairs, like ETH-USDT are the easiest to keep track of an asset, in terms of dollar value, trading pairs with Bitcoin, such as ETH-BTC can often give you a better sense of how well a cryptocurrency is performing relative to others.</p>

<p>This is obviously pertaining to altcoins.</p>

<h3 id="candles">CANDLES</h3>

<p>Without further ado, let’s take a look at a few of the key elements used in technical analysis.</p>

<p>Almost everything in technical analysis involves the candlestick chart.</p>

<p>Most of you are probably familiar with it by now, but I bet a lot of you still can’t explain exactly what it is, or what it shows you.</p>

<p>When it comes to trading each candle you see on that graph, in a standard cryptocurrency exchange gives you a snapshot of the trading activity within a given unit of time.</p>

<p>For example, if you have the chart set for one hour, each candle will represent one hour of trading activity for that asset pair.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, a green candle mean prices went up during that period, and a red candle means that prices went down.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Almost all the candles you see, will have something called a <strong>body</strong> and a <strong>wick</strong>.</p>

<p>The body is the thicker part of the candle, and the wick are those lines you see, poking from the top or the bottom.</p>

<p>For green candles, the bottom of the body is the price, that the trading started at, during the time period, and for red candles it’s the top of the body.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>When you see a candle, as almost nobody, it means, that almost all of the trading during that time period took place within a very narrow price range.</p>

<p>This means that the price did not change during that time.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>When you see a candle that’s almost all body with no wicks, that means price either moved to the upside or to the downside during that period.</p>

<p>The bigger these candles are the more fomo or fud we feel.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Wicks on a candle denote the highest and lowest trading prices during that time frame.</p>

<p>These wicks are incredibly useful, because they can tell us when traders are taking profits or buying the dip.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>A long wick on the bottom of a candle suggests, that traders are buying the dip, meaning price could still be bullish.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>A long wick at the top of a candle suggests, that traders are itching to take profits, which could be foreshadowing a shakeout.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>However, it’s only when you factor in trading volume, that you can really start making price predictions with candlestick charts.</p>

<h3 id="trading-volume">TRADING VOLUME</h3>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Factoring in trading volume is critical for good technical analysis.</p>

<p>Each volume bar you see at the bottom of a trading window, shows you <strong>the amount of an asset, that was traded during the time frame you’ve set</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, you want to be trading on a market with lots of volume.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Low volume tends to lead to price volatility, meaning that price could suddenly spike up or down.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Pro tip: volume is the first thing you should look at, when you’re considering buying some hot altcoin.</strong></p>

<p>On a shady cryptocurrency exchange some lesser-known exchanges will even set longer default trading time periods to hide low liquidity and questionable price action.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Make sure that you still see a high amount of trading volume with shorter time frames, before throwing your money into the void.</p>

<h4 id="price-trend-due-to-volume">PRICE TREND DUE TO VOLUME</h4>

<p>Volume is used by many traders to confirm a price trend.</p>

<p>For example, imagine you see the price of your favorite altcoin steadily dropping most of the candlesticks in the last few hours or days.</p>

<p>Have been read and it’s not getting any better.</p>

<p>Without looking at the volume, you might think this means you’re headed for some hurt.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>But when you check the volume, and you see that as price continues to drop, trading volume is also dropping.</p>

<p>This means that the downtrend you see is not very strong, despite what the price action might have.</p>

<p>You believe the bulls are standing by, and once the volume drops low enough, volatility kicks back in and the bulls are off to the races.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>The same is true, if the price is rising and trading volume is decreasing.</p>

<p>This means that there’s only a matter of time, before volatility strikes, and that could bring a strong reversal in price action.</p>

<h2 id="common-patterns-found-in-trading">COMMON PATTERNS FOUND IN TRADING</h2>

<p>Now, that you have a solid grasp of candlesticks and trading volume, let’s take a closer look at some of the common patterns found in trading.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever seen an expert trader in action, you know they love to draw lines as much as the fed loves to print money.</p>

<p>When traders draw lines, they’re normally looking for three things.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Support</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Resistance</strong></li>
  <li><strong>and a Recognizable Price Pattern</strong></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="support">SUPPORT</h5>

<p>Support refers to the lower limit of where the price of an asset could go.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="resistance">RESISTANCE</h5>

<p>Resistance refers to the upper limit of where the price of an asset could go.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>There are many ways to assess, where the support and resistant prices could be.</p>

<p>The simplest method is to look at the lowest and highest prices hit during a given time period.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>If you draw a resistance line across the tops, and a support line across the bottoms, it will give you a sense, of how much volatility the market could experience.</p>

<p>Going forward, which direction the price is likely moving, and even when to sell and when to buy.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>More often than not drawing these support and resistance lines reveals a recognizable price pattern.</p>

<p>There are dozens of price patterns, and most of these have stood the test of time continuing to repeat themselves in every market.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Ever since Honma Munihisa first defined, them almost 300 years ago, of all these patterns <strong>triangle patterns</strong> are considered to be the most reliable by professional traders.</p>

<p><strong>Triangle is created every time support and resistant lines converge.</strong></p>

<p>The two most common triangle patterns are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ascending triangles, and</strong></li>
  <li><strong>descending triangles</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>In an <strong>ascending triangle</strong>, the resistance line is more or less flat, and the support line is angled upwards.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>In a <strong>descending triangle</strong> the resistance line is angled downwards and the support line is flat.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Why the hell are these triangles so important?</p>

<p>Well, when the current price reaches the edge of an ascending triangle, price tends to spike upwards, and when it reaches the edge of a descending triangle, the price tends to drop.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Oddly enough, you can often use the left side of the triangle to determine, just how much the price will change to the upside or to the downside.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h2 id="techncial-indicators">TECHNCIAL INDICATORS</h2>

<p>If this feels a bit too arbitrary, you can use a number of technical indicators to help you double check, if you’re on the right track.</p>

<p>With your support and resistance lines, there are literally hundreds of different indicators, that people use in technical analysis trading.</p>

<p>Some of these are free to use, and others you will have to pay for.</p>

<p>Unless you’re planning on being the next wolf of wall street, free technical indicators will be more than enough to build a robust trading strategy.</p>

<p>There are 4 technical indicators, that you should know if you want to effectively trade cryptocurrency:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moving Averages,</li>
  <li>the MACD,</li>
  <li>the RSI, and</li>
  <li>Bollinger Bands.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h4 id="emas">EMAs</h4>

<p>Moving Average indicators draw the average price of an asset over a given period of time.</p>

<p>Exponential Moving Averages, or EMAs are commonly used in technical analysis trading.</p>

<p>Without getting into the details, EMAs put more weight on more recent prices when projecting a trend, and react faster to price changes.</p>

<p>Many traders believe EMAs to be the most useful Moving Average indicators.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>For this reason, EMAs, especially the 200-day EMA, are considered to be very important price zones for many traders.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>If the current price of a cryptocurrency is below its 200-day EMA, then it might see some resistance, when it hits the 200-day EMA line.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>In contrast, if the price of a cryptocurrency is above its 200-day EMA, the 200-day EMA line is often considered to be a strong zone of price support.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>The reasoning here is that, the market has basically agreed that the fair price for that cryptocurrency is somewhere within that range, as evidenced by the aggregated price action.</p>

<p>When a short-term Moving Average, such as the 20-day EMA crosses the 200-day Moving Average from above, this is called a <strong>death cross</strong> and signals to traders, that we’re headed for a downturn in that market.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Bitcoin experienced a death cross just over a week before the flash crash in March, where it dropped by 60% in price.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>When a shorter term Moving Average, such as the 20-day EMA crosses the 200-day Moving Average from below, this is called a <strong>golden cross</strong> and signals that there are many green days ahead for that market.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Bitcoin experienced the golden cross in May.</p>

<p>Its price jumped from 8000 to 10000 shortly afterwards, and has been in an uptrend ever since.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h3 id="macd">MACD</h3>

<p>There is another powerful technical indicator, based on Moving Averages called the MACD.</p>

<p><strong>MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence.</strong></p>

<p>It’s used to determine new trends in price and measure price volatility.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>For the purposes of this video, all I’ll say about the MACD is that, <strong>when the two lines you see are far apart it means, that price volatility is low.</strong></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>The closer those lines are together, the higher the volatility.</p>

<p>If those two lines cross this indicates, that the price is going to change direction, in the coming hours or days, and the direction of the bars, you see, will tell you which way the price is likely to go.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h3 id="rsi">RSI</h3>

<p>Now, for my personal favorite, the RSI short for Relative Strength Index.</p>

<p>The RSI is a favorite among cryptocurrency traders.</p>

<p><strong>This is because it tells you if a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued.</strong></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>The RSI indicator is drawn within a number range of naught to 100.</p>

<p>You can see this on the right hand side of the RSI’s indicator window.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><strong>If the current position of the indicator is below 30, this means that the cryptocurrency you’re looking at is probably undervalued.</strong></p>

<p>In other words, it’s time to <strong>buy</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><strong>However, if the indicator is positioned over 70, the crypto you’re looking at is entering bubble territory.</strong></p>

<p>It’s time to <strong>sell</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>The trend of the RSI line will give you a sense of whether the cryptocurrency, you’re looking at, is becoming overvalued or undervalued as time goes on.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>As long, as you’re within the 30 to 70 range, the price is right.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h3 id="bollinger-band-indicator">BOLLINGER BAND INDICATOR</h3>

<p>Finally, we have the Bollinger Band indicator.</p>

<p>Like the MACD, the Bollinger Band indicator is used to measure market volatility.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>In contrast to the MACD, the wider the lines are on the bollinger band indicator, the more volatility there is.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Traders, who use the Bollinger Band will generally buy, when there is low volatility, and sell, when there is high volatility, assuming price has gone to the upside during that volatile period.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>If you slap the Bollinger Band indicator on your favorite crypto, and see that its price is outside of the indicators range, its high time to buy or sell, depending on whether the price is pushing beneath or piercing through the top of the indicator’s range.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h4 id="technical-indicators---conclusion">TECHNICAL INDICATORS - CONCLUSION</h4>

<p>Using the various EMAs, the MACD, the RSI, and the Bollinger Band in tandem, should give you all the information you need, to execute effective short-term trades on your favorite cryptos.</p>

<p>Just remember that what you see, can, and probably will, change the second you adjust the time frame, so are you ready to go out and sell those tops and buy those dips?</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>As I said, it’s going to take lots of time, lots of practice, and lots of patience to build a solid trading strategy.</p>

<p>I think I covered most of what you need to, at least start dabbling in technical analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Candlestick charts show you much more than basic price action.</strong></p>

<p>They can show things like, whether people are buying the dip or taking profits.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing trend lines on candlestick charts reveals patterns that have repeated themselves in the markets for hundreds of years.</strong></p>

<p>These will help give you a sense of where the price might be heading.</p>

<p><strong>Taking note of the trading volume will confirm whether that price action is genuine or not.</strong></p>

<p>Moving Averages, the MACD, the RSI, and the Bollinger Band will help <strong>add some perspective to your initial calculations, by giving a more accurate picture of price volatility, identify any possible bubbles, or buying opportunities, and warn you of any incoming crashes or moonshots.</strong></p>

<p>Be sure, to double check the time frames you’re working with, and remember, that you’ll probably have to use slightly different trading strategies for different cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>It’s also important to remember, that technical indicators are not the be-all and end-all of cryptocurrency trading, and keeping the fundamentals in mind will go a long way, to helping make sure you see more green, than red over the long term.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more to cryptocurrency trading that I didn’t cover.</p>

<p>Sentiment analysis, whale movements, fibonacci retracements, there is still so much left to cover.</p>

    <time datetime="2021-07-30T16:10:35+01:00" class="post-date">30 Jul 2021</time>

    <h5 id="leading-questions">LEADING QUESTIONS</h5>
<p>What is Ripple?</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>Is XRP, Ripple’s cryptocurrency, a good investment?</p>

<p>And what does this all have to do  with the banking system?</p>

<h5 id="international-transactions">INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS</h5>
<p>Today’s topic is Ripple and XRP, one of the leading cryptocurrencies around.</p>

<p>Have you ever had occasion where you  needed to wire money to someone only to be told it might take several days for that money to appear  in their account?</p>

<p>That’s because most major banks are still using systems that were built  40 years ago for this task.</p>

<p>Swift, MoneyGram and Western Union  are just some examples of slow, expensive  and relatively limited systems that financial services use  to transfer money.</p>

<h5 id="transaction-going-through-intermediary-banks">TRANSACTION GOING THROUGH INTERMEDIARY BANKS</h5>
<p>On top of that, not all of the banks are connected  via the same network.</p>

<p>So, in many cases, you don’t even have a direct line  between two banks when they need to transfer money  from one account to the other.</p>

<p>In order for bank A  to send money to bank B that it doesn’t have  any direct relationship with, more often than not it will have to go through  several intermediary banks, searching for common network connections  between each other in order to clear a path for the money.</p>

<p>That’s why international wire transfers  are so slow and costly;</p>

<h5 id="money-conversations">MONEY CONVERSATIONS</h5>
<p>Each bank along the way  takes time to process the transaction and a fee for servicing the process.</p>

<p>In some cases, bank transfers must involve  currency conversions, which make things  even more problematic and expensive.</p>

<p>For example, directly transferring currency  from Japan to Nicaragua, means turning Yens into Cordobas, which is generally not feasible.</p>

<p>The reason is that Japanese banks don’t usually hold accounts  denominated in Cordobas because there’s not  a lot of demand for them.</p>

<p>However, both Japanese  and Nicaraguan banks hold accounts in dollars.</p>

<p>So instead, an individual or bank  will usually trade Yens for Dollars and then Dollars to Cordobas.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this process can be costly  due to the multiple conversions.</p>

<h5 id="ripple-for-banks-to-transfer-ash-around-the-world">RIPPLE FOR BANKS TO TRANSFER ASH AROUND THE WORLD</h5>
<p>In short, the banking system today doesn’t have a main connecting network  with a uniform set of rules.</p>

<p>Each time you want to exchange  or send money through the banking system, you need to find a path  to transfer that money, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what Ripple  is here to change.</p>

<p>Just like the Internet has its own rules,  or protocol, to transfer information known as http. RippleNet uses a protocol,  known as RTXP, for moving value around the world.</p>

<h5 id="ripple-nets">RIPPLE NETS</h5>
<p>Ripple Labs, the creators of RippleNet, aim to create the “Internet of Value” - a way for money to move  as quickly as information does.</p>

<p>Through the use of RippleNet, there is no reason to pay a fortune  and wait days when transferring money globally.</p>

<p>The idea for Ripple  was actually first conceived way back in 2004 by Ryan Fugger and was called RipplePay, but in 2012 was passed to  Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen who founded OpenCoin  later to be called Ripple Labs.</p>

<p>Unlike most cryptocurrencies  who focus on the individual, Ripple Labs aims to serve banks  and payment providers, allowing them to lower transaction costs  and expedite settlements.</p>

<h5 id="how-does-it-work-validators-gateways">HOW DOES IT WORK? VALIDATORS, GATEWAYS</h5>
<p>But how does it all work?</p>

<p>RippleNet is a network based on  a set of rules known as the Ripple Transaction Protocol  or RTXP for short.</p>

<p>The network consists of computers,  known as validators, that are spread around the world and maintain a shared ledger of  who owns what.</p>

<p>Validators make sure every transaction  sent through the network follows the RTXP rules.</p>

<p>Anyone can run a validator  and help maintain the Ripple network just like anyone can run a Bitcoin node  to maintain the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Companies who want to access  the Ripple network can use gateways.</p>

<p>Gateways,  which are usually run by banks, act as entry points to Ripple  for people outside the network.</p>

<p>It’s the same idea as going to a bank  or a credit company to gain access to the banking system.</p>

<p>So Ripple basically offers businesses  an alternative to the banking system in the form of an Internet of value  called RippleNet.</p>

<h5 id="our-money-can-be-on-xrp-and-we-might-not-know">OUR MONEY CAN BE ON XRP AND WE MIGHT NOT KNOW</h5>
<p>Ripple products like xRapid,  xVia and xCurrent are offered to companies  in order to optimize their current solutions for transfering money  around the world.</p>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that for you, as a customer of a financial service  using Ripple, this solution is transparent.</p>

<p>If the bank switches to this technology, your bank account balance  could be residing on the XRP ledger tomorrow and you would never know it.</p>

<h5 id="two-types-of-currency">TWO TYPES OF CURRENCY</h5>
<p>This all sounds great, but what type of currency  can actually be sent through the Ripple Network?</p>

<p>Well, unlike other cryptocurrency protocols  which support only their own asset, Ripple offers  two different types of “currencies”: IOUs and XRP.</p>

<h5 id="iou">IOU</h5>
<p>IOUs are tokens on the Ripple network  that can be stored on any Ripple wallet.</p>

<p>Just like we can store  a variety of Ethereum tokens on an Ethereum wallet, we can have plenty of tokens  coexisting on the same Ripple wallet.</p>

<p>But we really should  stop the comparison here, since this is as far as the similarities go.</p>

<p>Any participant on the Ripple network  can issue an IOU, however an IOU doesn’t represent  something you OWN.</p>

<p>It represents something you OWE.</p>

<p>It’s a debt, an obligation to pay back  something you got in real life.</p>

<p>When I issue an IOU to someone, it means I owe them something.</p>

<p>When I hold an IOU  issued by someone else, it means someone owes me something.</p>

<p>Each IOU has a name  that is comprised out of who issued it and what it represents.</p>

<p>For example, USD.Bitstamp is an IOU  issued by Bitstamp promising to pay back USD dollars.</p>

<p>An IOU can be issued for  any type of real world asset.</p>

<p>For example you can have an IOU for dollars, EUROs,  gold, oil, airline miles and even cows.</p>

<p>For each asset we borrow,  we will issue a new IOU.</p>

<p>Unlike other forms of debt  that can be traded, IOUs for the same asset type  are not interchangeable if they were issued by two different people.</p>

<p>For example, if I borrow money from you  and issue you a 20 USD.Nate IOU, that IOU can’t be added to  a 20 USD.Bitstamp IOU.</p>

<h5 id="depends-on-trust">DEPENDS ON TRUST</h5>

<p>Since each IOU has a different credit line  or trust line you can only redeem  the USD.Nate IOU from me.</p>

<p><strong>It’s important to note that  the IOU itself is not the asset, it’s just a promise by the issuer  to give you the asset back in the future.</strong></p>

<p>This promise won’t do you any good  if the issuer isn’t good for his word.</p>

<p>That’s why trust plays  an important issue with IOUs.</p>

<p>In order for you to accept  an IOU from someone you have to trust that  they will be able to pay you back.</p>

<p>In RippleNet this is known as a trust line.</p>

<p>A trust line is somewhat similar to  a line of credit with the bank.</p>

<p>It’s an agreement to trust someone  up to a limited amount of money.</p>

<h5 id="xrp">XRP</h5>
<p>Aside from IOUs there is another currency  the Ripple protocol supports - XRP.</p>

<p>XRP is a currency issued by Ripple Labs to help transfer payments  through the Ripple Network.</p>

<p>For example, if a bank wants to move  large amounts of money, instead of needing to use  multiple intermediary banks to transfer the money, it can just convert the money to XRP  and send that XRP to the recipient bank.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that two banks don’t have to use XRP  to transfer assets between them.</p>

<p>Instead, they can choose to keep  an ‘open tab’ using IOUs only, without ever closing it.</p>

<h5 id="tradable-asset-and-no-trust-needed">TRADABLE ASSET AND NO TRUST NEEDED</h5>
<p>Still, XRP is a form of payment  that unlike an IOU is final and is considered a tradable asset  by anyone on the network.</p>

<p>Unlike IOUs,  XRP is the actual asset so there is no counterparty risk.</p>

<p>In other words,  once you’ve received payment in XRP, the transaction is made and there’s no fear that the other party  will not meet its obligations for payment.</p>

<h5 id="if-xrp-is-so-cool-why-iou">IF XRP IS SO COOL, WHY IOU?</h5>
<p>So, if no trust is needed  and no trust line needs to be opened when sending XRP  to other network participants, why do we even need IOU?</p>

<p>The simple answer is that XRP,  being a cryptocurrency asset by itself, is relatively volatile  and also not respected worldwide.</p>

<p>IOUs, on the other hand, are treated and valued  as the assets each represent.</p>

<h5 id="more-pros-of-xrp">MORE PROS OF XRP</h5>
<p>XRP has additional advantages as well.</p>

<p>It’s fast and scalable.</p>

<p>Sending an XRP transaction  through the network takes 4 seconds as opposed to Bitcoin’s  10 minute average.</p>

<p>Also, XRP can handle  1,500 transactions per second while Bitcoin can handle only 7.</p>

<p>So the upside of using XRP  as a form of payment is pretty obvious.</p>

<h5 id="can-xrp-be-mined">CAN XRP BE MINED?</h5>
<p>One question people ask us a lot is “if XRP is a cryptocurrency,  can it be mined?”</p>

<p>The answer is - no, it can’t.</p>

<p>Mining in Bitcoin is done  in order to confirm and determine the order of transactions  on the blockchain.</p>

<p>In Ripple transactions are handled  through a different process.</p>

<p>Let me explain:</p>

<h5 id="validators-rules-the-blockchain">VALIDATORS RULES THE BLOCKCHAIN</h5>
<p>When an XRP transaction is broadcast  through the network, the validators that maintain the network  decide if it’s valid or not through voting.</p>

<p>When a validator receives the transaction, it consults with other trusted validators and they vote on whether  the transaction is valid.</p>

<p>If 80% or more vote it “valid” - the transaction is updated  in the Ripple ledger.</p>

<p>This list of trusted validators  that a validator consults with is known as a Unique Node List  or UNL for short.</p>

<p>Each validator has its own UNL.</p>

<p>Deciding who will be included  in the validaor’s UNL is completely up to the person  who runs the validator.</p>

<p>However, Ripple offers  a default list of trusted validators.</p>

<p>Validators don’t get compensated  for their work like Bitcoin miners do with new coins.</p>

<h5 id="xrp-is-pre-mined">XRP IS PRE-MINED</h5>
<p>When Ripple Labs started out they actually issued, or “pre-mined”,  a total of 100 billion XRP and according to the Ripple protocol, no more XRP can ever be created.</p>

<p>You might be wondering, who owns all of these pre-mined coins?</p>

<p>20 Billion XRP  were given to Ripple founders - Jed Macaleb, Chris Larsen  and Arthur Britto.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs holds around 7 billion XRP.</p>

<p>40 billion XRP have been sold  to companies and individuals.</p>

<p>The remaining supply  is sealed in a smart contract that releases 1 billion XRP  into Ripple Labs’ hands each month until all of the 100 billion XRP cap  will be reached.</p>

<h5 id="some-extra-info">SOME EXTRA INFO</h5>
<p>XRP can be divided into 6 decimal points with the smallest unit  being known as a drop.</p>

<p>If you want to hold XRP you will need a wallet  that supports the currency and a minimum deposit of 20 XRP  in your account.</p>

<p>This is done in order to prevent people  from spamming the Ripple Network by opening a large number of accounts.</p>

<h5 id="deflactional">DEFLACTIONAL</h5>
<p>One last thing to know about XRP is that  the XRP supply decreases over time making it, in theory,  more valuable as time passes.</p>

<p>This is done through destroying  the transaction fees attached to each XRP transaction.</p>

<p>For example, at the time of shooting this video we’re down to about 99.99% of  the original 100 Billion XRP.</p>

<p>The “missing” XRP are transaction fees  that have been destroyed and can never be used again.</p>

<h5 id="is-it-a-good-investition">IS IT A GOOD INVESTITION?</h5>
<p>So, is it a good idea to invest in XRP?</p>

<p>When people invest in XRP they are basically betting that in the future banks and institutions  will use XRP to move value and will therefore buy XRP  and drive up its price.</p>

<p>Of course,  banks could always use IOUs instead and that will keep XRP’s price  rather stagnant.</p>

<p>Therefore, the question of  “will XRP rise in value?”, is mainly a question of whether  a majority of banks and payment providers choose to utilize it instead of their current infrastructure.</p>

<h5 id="is-it-decentralized-then">IS IT DECENTRALIZED THEN?</h5>
<p>Before we end this video I want to touch upon one more subject and that’s the criticism about Ripple  being a centralized platform.</p>

<p>There are many arguments for both sides, and while I clearly have my opinion</p>

<p>I will try to display  some of the main points of debate.</p>

<h3 id="key-points">KEY POINTS</h3>

<h5 id="no-cnotrol-over-the-protocol">(+)NO CNOTROL OVER THE PROTOCOL</h5>
<p>Just like Bitcoin, once Ripple’s protocol is published, Ripple Labs has no control over it.</p>

<p>Validators run the code themselves.</p>

<p>This is pretty similar to  Bitcoin’s core development team maintaining the Bitcoin protocol but having no real control  over the nodes that run it.</p>

<h5 id="--but-still-has-something-to-say">(-)… BUT STILL HAS SOMETHING TO SAY</h5>
<p>But while Ripple Labs  doesn’t control the protocol, it does have a lot of influence  since it is the organization maintaining it.</p>

<p>So, if for some good reason  it  determined  to create more coins, it might succeed.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs is sort of  a central bank for RippleNet.</p>

<h5 id="validators-above-ripple-labs">(+)VALIDATORS ABOVE RIPPLE LABS</h5>

<p>The Ripple protocol itself is open source, meaning that if Ripple Labs  ceases to exist, the validators can still run  the network themselves.</p>

<h5 id="-products-arent-open-source-though">(-)PRODUCTS AREN’T OPEN SOURCE THOUGH</h5>

<p>On the other hand, products the company offers  to banks and institutions aren’t open source  and are run solely by Ripple Labs.</p>

<h5 id="-only-few-validators">(-)ONLY FEW VALIDATORS</h5>

<p>The number of Ripple validators today  is relatively small, and is a fraction of the number of Bitcoin nodes  that maintain the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Since these relatively few validators are ultimately responsible for maintaining  the integrity of the network, this raises the question: how can we know the validators  aren’t colluding in order to defraud Ripple’s users?</p>

<h5 id="-iou-tokens-demanding-trust">(-)IOU TOKENS DEMANDING TRUST</h5>

<p>Another attribute in Ripple  that raises concern is that you ultimately have to depend on trust  in order to use the IOU tokens.</p>

<p>In contrast, Bitcoin’s entire system is designed to work  in a trustless environment.</p>

<h5 id="--ripple-monitors-and-reports-suspicious-activity-to-authorities">(-) RIPPLE MONITORS AND REPORTS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY TO AUTHORITIES</h5>

<p>Additionally, while Bitcoin is free for all  and censorship resistant, Ripple is committed to  monitoring and reporting any Anti-Money Laundering flags  across the network, as well as reporting suspicious activity  to relevant authorities.</p>

<h5 id="more-energy-efficient-since-theres-no-mining">(+)MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT SINCE THERE’S NO MINING</h5>

<p>On the upside, since there’s no such thing  as Ripple mining, the network itself  is much more energy efficient compared to Bitcoin’s  extreme energy consumption.</p>

<h5 id="final-thoughts">FINAL THOUGHTS</h5>
<p>In the end, there’s no clear answer to  whether Ripple is decentralized or not.</p>

<p>Personally I think the real  question of centralization arises when there’s one key figure  or company that has implicit power  over what the community thinks.</p>

<p><strong>And in this case, Ripple Labs undoubtedly  has the most influence on the entire Ripple community, making it much more  centralized in nature than Bitcoin.</strong></p>

<p>It’s up to you to decide  if you think Ripple is centralized or not, or whether that even matters.</p>

<p>Ripple isn’t built  on the same ideals as Bitcoin.</p>

<p>It’s a ‘for profit’ company,  serving the banking system.</p>

<p>Perhaps this centralized solution is a more efficient means  of international transaction, but is it the right one?</p>

<p>Hopefully by now you understand  what Ripple is and how it works -</p>

<p>A network designed to move value  around the world, mainly aimed at banks  and payment providers.</p>

    <h2 id="tokenomics">TOKENOMICS</h2>
<p><strong>Tokenomics - Token economics.</strong> Include a whole series of metrics relating to cryptocurrency, coin or token such as supply, allocation, distribution, emission and utility.</p>

<p>Coins are used to pay fees on their native network, are used to transfer value and are given as a reward to miners when a new block is mined.</p>

<p>Instead of being used for baseline newtwork activities like fee payments tokens often have unique use cases thatare specific to the projects that made them</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong></p>

<p>Decentraland’s MANA token which is burned to purchase digital assets on the decentraland marketplace.</p>

<h4 id="supply">SUPPLY</h4>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Dogecoind is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap even though the dollar value of each coin is low.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Other crypto, like Yarn.finance’s WIFI token, have a small supply, and its why one WIFI is worth more than one BTC, even though it has 1/4 of the market cap of Dogecoin.</p>

<p>Therefore WIFI has more potential to grow compared to Dogecoin.</p>

<p>This is because its easier for a cryptocurrency with a market cap of 1.7 billion to double in value, than a crypto with a market cap of 8.6 billion.</p>

<p>Each crypto’s market cap is calculated by multyplying the number of coins or tokens in circulation with the currenct price of that coin or token.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>In circulation means wihout the tokens that hasnt been mined yet or are locked.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Fully diluted valuation</strong> - theoretical market cap of the crypto if every coin or token was in circulation.</p>

<h3 id="allocation-and-distribution">Allocation and Distribution</h3>

<p>Cryptocurerncies are creaed in two ways - by <strong>fair launch</strong> or by <strong>pre-mine</strong> a fair launch.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fair launch - a small community of people start collectively mining a coin or token (BTC, litecoin, degecoin). No coin or token accolactions for fair launch cryptos. Allocation is relevant to any crypto that were premined.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pre-mine is when the team behind the project mint some or all of the coins or tokoens before opening up the network to the public. A portion of these pre-mined coins or tokens is usually sold prior to the launch of the network to raise the funds needed to build it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the coins we see today were originally sold as tokens. Specifically ERC20 tokens on ethereum.</p>

<p>ICO - initial coin offering</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Distribution of ETH. The ones in boxes are smart contracts, not actual wallets.</p>

<h3 id="vesting-and-inflation">VESTING AND INFLATION</h3>

<p>Applies to pre-mined cryptocurrencies and refers to how the coins or tokens are expected to be allocated over the coming months or years.</p>

<p>It’s common for cryptocurrency projects with a pre-mine to lock up a certain portion of their tokens and gradually release them over time. This increases the confidence of regular token holders, that the market won’t be flooded by tokens allocated to the team and private investors.</p>

<p>Usually there vesting schedules are pretty logical and take place over many years.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Extremly careful with the graph as the one above.</strong></p>

<p>Unlocking too many tokens at once or within a short time frame can sink the price action of that token in the short term.</p>

<p>When it comes to inflation, cryptocurrency is either <strong>inflationary</strong> or <strong>deflationary</strong>.</p>

<p>If a crypto has too much inflation, it can reduce the value of the coins or tokens already in circulation over time.</p>

<p>Unless the inflation schedule is extremly aggressive, it will have little to no effect on the short-term price potential of a cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies often have some degree of inflation to incentivize validators and delegators on their networks.</p>

<p>This normally ranges anywhere between 5-15%.</p>

<p>Crypto like Polkadot adjust their inflation based on staking participation to maintime the security of the network.</p>

<p>Many DeFi tokens also use inflation to reward liquidity providers and yield farmers on their respective protocols.</p>

<p>DeFi tokens often have incredibly aggressive inflation schedules to keep their annual percentage yields.</p>

<p>If the crypto is defiationary the reduction in supply increases the value of that crypto over time.</p>

<p>While this may also not have a big influence in the short term, this deflation is part of why cryptocurrencies like BTC are so valuable.</p>

<p>Although new BTC are mined every 10 mins, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 milllion and the amount of new BTC being created per block is cut in half roughly every four years.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is deflationary because of <strong>accidential loss</strong>.</p>

<p>Everytime some mofo forgets their password, it reduces the supply of crypto in circulation.</p>

<p>This means that crypto with a maximum supply like BTC are deflationary in practice.</p>

<p>Conversely, some cryptocurrencies intentionally reduce their supply by burning coins or tokens.</p>

<p>For example, an upgrade to Ethereum that’s currently in thr works would burn part of the ETH used to pay for network fees.</p>

<p>Even though Ethereum is echnically inflationary, if enough people are using this network, the fee burns will be more than the inflation, which would turn ETH into a deflationary asset.</p>

<p>Some belive that this change could propel the price of ETH well past 20k dollars.</p>

<p>Unfortunately to the people staking their ETH on Ethereum 2.0, they probably won’t be able to realize those gains even when they come.</p>

<h3 id="staking-and-utility">STAKING AND UTILITY</h3>

<p>When you stake a cryptocurrency as a validator or a delegator, those coins or tokens are usually locked up for some period of time.</p>

<p>In the case  of Ethereum 2.0 any ETH being stake will not be unlocked until 2022.</p>

<p>At the earliest, this means, that if the price of ETH starts to skyrocket, all the ETH being staked is not going to be making it onto any exchanges.</p>

<p>This conveniently restricts the actual circulating supply of ETH which could enhance the positive price action.</p>

<p>This effect is much bigger for other proof-of-stake crypto like Polkadot, where more than 60% of DOT’s supply is being staked. 28 day unlock period.</p>

<p>Cardano have no lock up periods for staked coins. This means that all of that staked ADA could move onto exchanges at a moment’s notice and push a parabolic move back down as people take profits.</p>

<p>Besides the restrictive effects on supply staking is also a common utility for many coins and tokens.</p>

<p><strong>Utility is also referred to as a use case and includes basically anything that drives demand for a cryptocurrency coin or token.</strong></p>

<p><strong>BTC’s primary utility is as a store of value, like gold.</strong></p>

<p>The difference is that, BTC is accessible to bascally anyone with an internet connection, whereas gold requires a bit more infrastructure to get your hands on and store.</p>

<p>Given how poorly fiat currencies hold their value these days, there is a lot of demand for an easily accessible store of value like Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Hence why it is the most valuable cryptocurrency on the market.</p>

<p><strong>Ethereum’s primary utility is to pay fees to use the decentralized applications built on it and move any ERC20 tokens around.</strong></p>

<p>There are hundres of Dapps and thousands of EREC20 tokens, which means a lot of demand for ETH to pay gas fees.</p>

<p>Hence, why it is the second most valuable cryptocurrency on the market.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Market caps of many DeFi tokens like ARVE are almost one-to-one with the total value locked on their protocols.</p>

<p>This makes it easy to spot DeFi crypto that are undervaluated or overvaluated.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>While crypto tokens may be more profitable investments, they are also riskier to hold because of the regulatory risks they face.</p>

<p>Moreover, token profits are often short-lived, as many cryptocurrency projects with tokens aren’t built to last for more than a few years.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency coins often support larger ecosystems, which include Dapps, crypto tokens that gives coins a longer shelf life and results in a more gradual increase in value as their ecosystem grow.</p>

<p>This growth in value isn’t always obvious, if you’re working off of te price alone.</p>

<p>Small circulating supplies can also threaten that value in near or distant future, if any of there idle coins or tokens start to move onto the market.</p>

<p>Usually its worth to value crypto based on their fully diluted market caps. This makes it easy to spot when a cryto is overvaluated or undervaluated regardless of its price tag.</p>
