<h2 id="stablecoins-recently">STABLECOINS RECENTLY</h2>

<p>Stablecoins have been in the spotlight over the last few weeks, and for all the wrong reasons.</p>

<p>Regulators are starting to get nervous about the impact stablecoins could have not just on the crypto market, but on the financial markets as a whole.</p>

<p>This is because the total market cap of all stablecoins combined currently stands at more than 100 billion dollars and counting this wouldn’t be a problem. if not for the fact, that the issuers of these stablecoins have not been very transparent about the assets, which back their dollar pegged tokens.</p>

<p>This is a problem, because if everyone went to cash out their stablecoins at the same time, there’s no telling, what could happen.</p>

<p>As it so happens, some of the largest stablecoin issuers recently revealed this information, and we now know the assets that back the three largest stablecoins in circulation.</p>

<h2 id="reason-for-the-stablecoins">REASON FOR THE STABLECOINS</h2>

<p><strong>Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies, that are designed to mirror the price of a regular fiat currency, usually the us dollar.</strong></p>

<p>Before stablecoins existed, traders would have to send their crypto, usually BTC, to a crypto-fiat payment gateway, whenever they wanted to capitalize on a gain or cut their losses.</p>

<p>This was not very efficient, because moving between crypto and fiat often incurred a lot of fees, and a busy blockchain or exchange could mean losing some of your gains or deepening your losses due to delays and downtime.</p>

<p>Stablecoins make it possible to cash out without actually having to convert your cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Interfered trading against a stablecoin also makes it much easier to calculate your gains and losses.</p>

<p>This is why stablecoins are so popular, and it’s also why most of the trading volume for any given coin or token comes from stablecoin pairs.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/1.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="demand-for-stablecoins-and-price-of-the-coin">DEMAND FOR STABLECOINS AND PRICE OF THE COIN</h2>

<p>Generally speaking, there are three types of stablecoin:</p>
<ul>
  <li>crypto,</li>
  <li>backed, and</li>
  <li>algorithmic</li>
</ul>

<p>All of them ultimately maintain their dollar pegs by adjusting their supply based on demand.</p>

<p><strong>When demand for a stablecoin is high enough, this can push its price above a dollar.</strong></p>

<p>This usually happens whenever the crypto market is dropping like a rock, because everyone is rushing to buy stablecoins to protect their portfolios from further losses.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/2.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Eventually new stablecoins are minted to meet this demand and restore the dollar peg.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/whale1.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Conversely, when people start selling their stablecoins to buy whichever crypto is currently going to the moon <strong>this sometimes manages to push the price of stable coins below a dollar.</strong></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/3.PNG" />
</center>

<p>When this happens, stablecoins are burned to reduce the supply, thereby raising the token’s price to put it back in line with its dollar peg.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/whale2.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Whereas crypto, backed and algorithmic stablecoins have automatic and incentive-based systems, which mint and burn tokens to meet demand, fiat-backed stablecoins rely on the companies which issued them to do this.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/demand.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="burning-and-minting-stablecoins">BURNING AND MINTING STABLECOINS</h2>

<p>In theory, the companies which issue fiat-backed stablecoins have an equivalent amount of dollars in the bank to back the tokens in circulation, across all cryptocurrency blockchains.</p>

<p>When fiat-backed stablecoins are minted, this means, that someone somewhere went to the company behind that stablecoin, and gave them dollars in exchange for tokens, which are then put into circulation.</p>

<p>When fiat-backed stablecoins are burned, this means that someone somewhere went to the company behind the stablecoin, and gave them tokens in exchange for dollars, which then takes those dollars out of circulation.</p>

<p>Having this one-to-one ratio of dollars to tokens is extremely important, because if there was ever a “<em>black swan event</em>”, that caused everyone to cash out of crypto, not having sufficient dollars in the bank means, not everyone would actually be able to convert their digital dollars into physical dollars.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, fiat back stablecoin issuers have historically not been very transparent about whether their tokens are fully backed by dollars.</p>

<p>This has led to a lot of stablecoin competition in the crypto space, with each new fiat back stablecoin company claiming, that its tokens are backed by more dollars, than its competitors tokens.</p>

<h2 id="one-ofe-the-big-ones---tether-usdt">ONE OFE THE BIG ONES - TETHER (USDT)</h2>

<p>The three largest stablecoin issuers have all recently revealed these details, which means we can finally assess, which of these stablecoins are legit, and which ones are backed by nothing more than <em>funny money</em>.</p>

<p><strong>USDT</strong> is the largest stablecoin circulating in the crypto market, and is issued by <strong>Tether</strong>.</p>

<p>Tether is based in Hong Kong and is closely affiliated with Bitfinex, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<p>Tether was founded in 2014, and its USDT stablecoin was originally built on top of Bitcoin, using the OMNI layer protocol.</p>

<p>Today USDT exists on OMNI, Ethereum, TRON, EOS, Liquid, Algorand, Solana, and even Bitcoin Cash.</p>

<p>Via the simple ledger protocol, about 50% of all the USDT in circulation exists on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.</p>

<p>Though apparently there have been no new USDT tokens issued on Ethereum since May.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-tether-earn">HOW DOES TETHER EARN?</h3>

<p>How Tether makes money off USDT?</p>

<p>The answer is <strong>fees</strong>.</p>

<p>In addition to a 0.1% cut of all fiat deposits and withdrawals, Tether charges 150 for KYC verification, which is required to mint and redeem USDT and the other stablecoins it offers.</p>

<h3 id="what-backs-usdt">WHAT BACKS USDT?</h3>

<p>Initially, Tether stated that USDT was backed one-to-one by US dollars in a bank.</p>

<p>This changed in March of 2019, when Tether rewrote the collateral clause to include “<em>other assets and receivables from loans, made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities”</em>.</p>

<p>Tether keeps track of the assets backing its various stable coins on the transparency page of its website, which is updated every day.</p>

<p>As you can see, there isn’t very much detail here.</p>

<p>Nobody really knew, what was backing USDT until mid-May this year, when Tether released a breakdown of its reserves as part of its settlement agreement with the New York Department of Justice.</p>

<p>According to Tether, the USDT in circulation is backed by the following assets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>76% cash cash equivalents, short-term deposits and commercial paper, which is divided into various categories in that orange pie chart. As one can see, it’s mostly in commercial paper, with just a sliver in cash.</li>
  <li>12.5% secured loans,</li>
  <li>10% corporate bonds funds and precious metals, and</li>
  <li>1.5% other assets, including digital tokens, aka <em>cryptocurrency</em>.</li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/tether-back.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="second-big-player---circle-usdc">SECOND BIG PLAYER - CIRCLE (USDC)</h2>

<p>USDC is the second largest stablecoin circulating in the crypto market, and it’s issued by Circle.</p>

<p>Circle is based in the United States, specifically Boston Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Circle was founded in 2013 and has raised over 770 million dollars from big names, such as Goldman Sachs, Bitman and Digital Currency Group.</p>

<p>Since that time in October 2018, Circle partnered with Coinbase to form the center consortium, which governs the USDC stablecoin.</p>

<p>USDC was initially issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, and this is where most of its circulating supply remains.</p>

<p>USDC can also be found on Algorand, Solana, TRON, Stella, and a few other blockchains.</p>

<p>The center consortium has been pushing to get USDC on as many cryptocurrency blockchains, as possible, and they recently announced plans to deploy on 10 additional cryptochains.</p>

<h3 id="how-circle-earns">HOW CIRCLE EARNS?</h3>

<p>In contrast to Tether, Circle seems to make most of its money from payments made in USDC?</p>

<p>Something which can now be done via Visa, thanks to the partnership they recently penned.</p>

<p>Circle has 0 fees for bank transfers, and also no fees for exchanging US dollars for USDC and vice versa.</p>

<p>This is one of the many reasons, why USDC has been growing at a faster rate than USDT as of late.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/circle-back.PNG" />
</center>

<h3 id="raport">RAPORT</h3>

<p>Another reason relates to the transparency reports around the assets backing USDC, which can be found on the Center Consortium website.</p>

<p>Grant Thornton, one of the largest accounting firms provides attestations of the assets backing USDC on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>Historically, these have not been very detailed and have provided about the same amount of information as Tether does on its transparency page.</p>

<p>However, in late July this year, Circle released a detailed breakdown of exactly which assets make up the dollar amount that’s backing USDC.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>The answer is that Circle is preparing to list on the stock exchange in a Spac deal, and they want to be as transparent as possible for regulators and both current and future shareholders.</p>

<p>According to Grant Thornton, the USDC in circulation is backed by the following assets:</p>

<ul>
  <li>61% Cash, and Cash Equivalents,</li>
  <li>13% Tankee Certificates of Deposit or CDs,</li>
  <li>12% US Treasuries,</li>
  <li>9% Commercial Paper,</li>
  <li>5% Corporate Bonds, and</li>
  <li>less than 1% in Municipal Bonds.</li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/circle-back.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="third-player---paxos-busd">THIRD PLAYER - PAXOS (BUSD)</h2>

<p>BUSD is the third largest stablecoin circulating in the crypto market, and it is issued by Paxos.</p>

<p>Paxos is also based in the United States, specifically New York.</p>

<p>Paxos was founded in 2012, and has likewise raised hundreds of millions of dollars over the years.</p>

<p>Most of this money came fromlesser known investors, but this list includes payment giants like Paypal.</p>

<p>Fun fact, Paxos actually custodies the cryptocurrencies being bought and sold on Paypal.</p>

<p>BUSD is technically a branded version of Paxos’s less popular PAX stablecoin, which went live in 2018.</p>

<p>BUSD is the product of Paxos’s partnership with Binance in September 2019, and it exists on Ethereum, the Binance Chain and the Binance Smart Chain.</p>

<p>All the assets which back BUSD are custodied by Paxos.</p>

<p>Like Circle, Paxos does not have any fees for the creation or redemption of its stablecoins.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-paxos-earn">HOW DOES PAXOS EARN?</h3>

<p>Paxos likely makes most of its money from providing crypto custody and crypto trading services to institutions.</p>

<p>Also like Circle, Paxos publishes monthly attestations of the dollars backing its digital token, and these are done with the help of with the “<em>nationally top ranking auditing firm</em>”.</p>

<p>Paxos’s asset attestations have likewise been very vague until last week, when Paxos pounced on the opportunity to flex, how much better PAX and BUSD are backed compared to USDC.</p>

<p>According to Whitham, 96% of all Paxos stablecoins are currently backed by cash or cash equivalents with 4% being backed by US treasuries.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/paxos-back.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="what-is-it-really-backed-by">WHAT IS IT REALLY BACKED BY?</h2>

<p>What are all these assets backing the largest stablecoins, and what makes them good or bad?</p>

<h3 id="tethers-usdt">TETHER’S USDT</h3>

<p>Starting with the small pie chart, almost everything, that’s mentioned there, is basically debt of some kind, in the form of a loan to a public or private institution.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Treasury Bills</strong> are short-term government <strong>debt</strong> reverse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Repo Notes</strong> can be stocks, but in this case they’re probably <strong>debt</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cash</strong> is <strong>cash</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Fiduciary Deposits</strong> are <strong>assets</strong> held in another bank on your behalf, and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Commercial Paper</strong> is unsecured short-term corporate <strong>debt</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the bigger pie chart, <strong>secured loans</strong> are of course <strong>debt</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Corporate bonds and funds</strong> are again <strong>debt</strong>, though <strong>precious metals</strong> aren’t.</p>

<p>And last, but not least, <strong>other investments, including digital currencies</strong>, which is probably <strong>Bitcoin</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/tether-back2.PNG" />
</center>

<h3 id="circles-usdc">CIRCLE’S USDC</h3>

<p>It’s a similar story with Circle’s own collateral.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cash Equivalents</strong> are actually short-term <strong>debt</strong>, and the reason why they’re called <em>Cash Equivalents</em>, is because they’re easy to cash out.</li>
  <li><strong>Yankee CDs</strong> are loans to foreign banks denominated in US dollars, a.k.a <strong>debt</strong>,</li>
  <li><strong>US treasuries</strong> are <strong>debt</strong>,</li>
  <li><strong>Commercial Paper</strong> is risky short-term corporate <strong>debt</strong>,</li>
  <li><strong>Corporate Bonds</strong> are safer corporate <strong>debt</strong>, and</li>
  <li><strong>Municipal Bonds</strong> are local government <strong>debt</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/circle-back2.PNG" />
</center>

<h3 id="paxos-busd">PAXOS’ BUSD</h3>

<p>Finally, we have Paxos’s reserves, most of which are, again, some form of public or private debt, and probably include a nice chunk of cash.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/paxos-back.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="why-they-hold-so-much-interest">WHY THEY HOLD SO MUCH INTEREST?</h2>

<p>Why all these stablecoin companies are holding so much debt?</p>

<p>The answer is <strong>interest</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’re sitting on billions of dollars in cash, and you know that all your customers probably aren’t going to come asking for it back at the same time, lending money to private and public institutions is a great way, to earn interest on that cash, even though most of the cash being loaned out by these stablecoin issuers will only earn a few percentage points per year.</p>

<p>That works out to a <em>massive</em> amount in dollar terms, when you’re dealing with that much capital.</p>

<p>It’s also not a big deal so long as the assets you’re investing in can be quickly changed back into dollars, at a moment’s notice to pay back any customers looking to cash their stable coins out.</p>

<h2 id="so-which-one-is-the-best">SO WHICH ONE IS THE BEST?</h2>

<p>It’s important to note, that Tether’s account of what’s backing USDT should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>That’s because they simply posted a pie chart, without oversight from any accounting or auditing firm.</p>

<p>While Paxos and Circle do provide attestations of their reserves on a monthly basis, is not the same as an audit.</p>

<p><strong>An attestation is just when a third party verifies the information being shown to them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>An audit is when a third party actually goes digging through all the paperwork to see, what’s not being shown to them.</strong></p>

<p>That said, Paxos apparently does get audited from time to time, and this is because it’s a trust company regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services.</p>

<p>Although none of these audits seem to be posted on Paxos’s website, its status as a trust company means that Paxos can only hold assets, that are safe liquid and insured in their reserves.</p>

<h2 id="is-paxos-the-most-promising">IS PAXOS THE MOST PROMISING?</h2>

<p>This is the biggest difference between Paxos and its two contemporaries, and it’s also why such a large percentage of Paxos’s reserves are made up of cash and cash equivalents.</p>

<p>Even if all their cash equivalents are debts of some kind, they are a form of debt, that can be quickly redeemed for dollars, regardless of market conditions.</p>

<p>This means that people, who hold BUSD or PAX can know for sure that they can cash out, even if the crypto market is collapsing.</p>

<p>The type of debt, that lies at the opposite end of the safety spectrum, is Commercial Paper, whose safety ultimately depends on the company, which issued it.</p>

<p>Almost 50% of Tether’s reserves are Commercial Paper, and there is of course no way of knowing, which corporations it came from.</p>

<p>The origin of Circle’s Commercial Paper is also unknown, but the bigger issue is that, the other assets it holds are not nearly as liquid as Cash Equivalents.</p>

<h2 id="in-times-of-black-swan-event">IN TIMES OF BLACK SWAN EVENT</h2>

<p>This means that in the event, that the financial markets are crashing across the board circle, could be 10-25% short of the dollars it needs for its customers to cash out in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, Tether doesn’t have this problem, because its legal disclaimer notes that “<em>Tether reserves the right to delay the redemption or withdrawal of Tether tokens, if such delay is necessitated by the illiquidity or unavailability, or loss of any reserves held by Tether</em>”.</p>

<p>And that “<em>Tether reserves the right to redeem Tether tokens by in-kind redemptions of securities and other assets held in the reserves</em>”.</p>

<p><strong>In other words, Tether doesn’t guarantee redemption of USDT for fiat at all.</strong></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/stablecoins/tether-right.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>

<p>Stablecoins have been contentious cryptocurrencies, and it’s easy to see why.</p>

<p>The lack of transparency from the companies, which issue fiat-backed stablecoins, is astounding to say the least, and regulators have reasons to be concerned.</p>

<p>Imagine, what would happen, if Tether, Circle and Paxos invested hundreds of billions of dollars into regular markets with their stablecoin collateral.</p>

<p>If the crypto market crashed and everyone came running to redeem their stablecoins, this would cause an unbelievable amount of cell pressure for whatever assets these stablecoin issuers are holding.</p>

<p>If most of that money happens to be sitting in assets, like home equities, it could potentially crash the housing market, and bring the stock market down with it.</p>

<p>While this might not be a risk today, at the rate that fiat back stablecoins are growing, it will be a risk sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>On the bright side, it’s extremely unlikely, that governments will ban fiat-backed stablecoins anytime soon.</p>

<p>They and the corporations, they bow to, need someone to buy all their debt after all.</p>

<h2 id="recognizability-and-branding">RECOGNIZABILITY AND BRANDING</h2>

<p>There are over 7000 cryptocurrencies and each has its own use case and tokenomics.</p>

<p>In theory, these two factors are meant to be the selling points for that coin or token.</p>

<p>In practice however, whether a crypto does well often boils down to recognizability and branding.</p>

<p>One of the cryptos that has both is Litecoin.</p>

<h2 id="litecoin-recently">LITECOIN RECENTLY</h2>

<p>It’s been around for almost 10 years, and is one of the oldest surviving altcoins on the market.</p>

<p>This makes it recognizable to investors, who have come across crypto in the past.</p>

<p>Litecoin has also branded itself as “<em>the silver to Bitcoin’s gold</em>” and this simple idea has played a key role in its survival over the last decade.</p>

<p>However, Litecoin has not just survived.</p>

<p>It has thrived and in recent weeks it’s been making its way back into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap.</p>

<p>As it turns out, there is more to this price action, than meets the eye.</p>

<h2 id="charlie-poker-player-and-crypto">CHARLIE, POKER PLAYER AND CRYPTO</h2>

<p>Litecoin was created by software developer Charlie Lee.</p>

<p>Charlie holds a Masters in Computer Science from MIT and worked as a software engineer at Google before becoming one of Coinbase’s earliest employees, serving as engineering director until 2017.</p>

<p>Charlie is also an active poker player, and this happens to be why he got involved in cryptocurrency in the first place.</p>

<p>In April 2011, regulatory authorities in the United States cracked down on the largest online poker websites in the country, effectively shutting them down for good.</p>

<p>This made Charlie “<em>realize the importance of the freedom of money</em>” and this inspired him to begin dabbling in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/charlie.jpg" />
</center>

<h2 id="start-of-ltc---fair-launch">START OF LTC - FAIR LAUNCH</h2>

<p>It didn’t take long for Charlie to see the same thing we see in crypto today.</p>

<p>Hundreds of coins that exist for no other purpose than to enrich their creators.</p>

<p>That’s why litecoin had a fair launch in October 2011 with no pre-mine.</p>

<p>This means no LTC was allocated to Charlie or any of the other chaps working on Litecoin.</p>

<p>Before its launch, Charlie mined Litecoin along with everyone else in the crypto community, in much the same way as Satoshi did with Bitcoin in 2009.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/safemoon.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="lighter-version-of-btc-used-for-everyday-payments">LIGHTER VERSION OF BTC USED FOR EVERYDAY PAYMENTS</h2>

<p>As the name suggests, Litecoin was designed to be a lighter version of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Whereas BTC is a stall of value, LTC is meant to be the sound money, that people will use for everyday payments.</p>

<p>This is why Charlie calls Litecoin “<em>the silver to Bitcoin’s gold</em>”, and why he actually advises people to invest in Bitcoin before anything else, including Litecoin.</p>

<h2 id="he-sold-his-ltc-and-was-hated">HE SOLD HIS LTC AND WAS HATED</h2>

<p>That said, many have called Charlie’s true motivations into question ever since he sold all his LTC at the peak of the previous bull market, just a few months after he quit his job at Coinbase.</p>

<p>Charlie says he sold his LTC, because he could see how much of an influence over its price he had through his Twitter account, which had an enormous following.</p>

<p>This didn’t do much to quell the concerns of the crypto community, who argued, that Charlie was jumping ship.</p>

<p>This earned Charlie the title of the most hated person in cryptocurrency in 2018.</p>

<h2 id="litecoin-foundation">LITECOIN FOUNDATION</h2>

<p>To Charlie’s credit, he continues to work as one of Litecoin’s core developers, and is also the managing director of the Litecoin Foundation, a Singaporean non-profit, that is funded by donations and merch sales .</p>

<p>What’s more is that, Charlie apparently matched all the donations made towards the development of Litecoin’s upcoming privacy features.</p>

<h2 id="differences-between-ltc-and-btc---proof-of-work---scrypt">DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LTC AND BTC - PROOF OF WORK - SCRYPT</h2>

<p>Before we get into those though, it’s probably a good idea to understand, how Litecoin works.</p>

<p>Litecoin is basically like Bitcoin, with a few modifications.</p>

<p>For starters, instead of the SHA-256 <strong>proof-of-work consensus mechanism</strong> Litecoin uses a special proof-of-work consensus mechanism called <strong>SCrypt</strong>.</p>

<p>SCrypt was meant to make it possible to mine LTC using a regular computer.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/scrypt.jpg" />
</center>

<p>This would make the Litecoin blockchain more decentralized, as anyone would be able to participate on the network.</p>

<p>This is in contrast to Bitcoin’s SHA-256 mining algorithm, which was only mineable using expensive specialized computers called ASICS, by the time Litecoin rolled around.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it didn’t take long for those clever crypto mining manufacturers to create a Scrypt ASICS2.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/antminer.PNG" />
</center>

<p>And since that time, the Litecoin blockchain has become gradually more centralized, with 8 mining pools accounting for most of its mining activity.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/5.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="ltc-merge-mined-with-dogecoin-for-security-reasons">LTC MERGE MINED WITH DOGECOIN FOR SECURITY REASONS</h2>

<p>One little-known fact about Litecoin is that, DOGE is merge mined with LTC.</p>

<p><strong>Without getting into the weeds, merge mining makes it possible to mine two cryptocurrencies without using any extra power.</strong></p>

<p>Dogecoin merge mining began after Litecoin founder Charlie Lee met with Dogecoin founder Jackson Palmer in 2014, and warned him, that the Dogecoin blockchain could be manipulated by its miners.</p>

<p>Merge mining with Litecoin would keep Dogecoin’s blockchain secure.</p>

<p>According to Jackson, Dogecoin is “<em>merged at the hip with Litecoin</em>”.</p>

<p>In other words, Dogecoin’s survival depends on Litecoin.</p>

<p>This is probably why Litecoin miners are partially to blame for Dogecoin’s crazy price action.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/doge.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="speed">SPEED</h2>

<p>Besides mining, Litecoin also differs from Bitcoin when it comes to speed cost and tokenomics.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/2.jpg" />
</center>

<p>The average LTC transaction usually costs no more than a few cents, and takes about 2 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>This works out to about 56 transactions per second.</p>

<h2 id="tokenomics">TOKENOMICS</h2>

<p>In terms of tokenomics, LTC has a maximum supply of 84 million, which is 4 times more than BTC’s maximum supply of 21 million.</p>

<h2 id="ltc-halving">LTC HALVING</h2>

<p>Like Bitcoin, Litecoin has a 4 year halving cycle, meaning, the amount of LTC, miners get from each block, is cut in half.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/3.PNG" />
</center>

<p>When the first Litecoin block was mined, the reward was 50 LTC.</p>

<p>The first halving occurred in August 2015, cutting the block reward to 25 LTC.</p>

<p>The second Litecoin halving happened in August 2019, which was cut in half again to 12.5 LTC.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/4.png" />
</center>

<p>The next Litecoin halving is scheduled to take place in August 2023, and though some websites suggest this reduction in supply is the driver behind LTC’s price action, LTC remains highly correlated to BTC.</p>

<p>This means that BTC is the primary driver behind LTC’s price action, and this is the case for most other cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h2 id="ltc-upgrades-following-the-btc-ones">LTC UPGRADES FOLLOWING THE BTC ONES</h2>

<p>The most interesting thing about Litecoin is that, many of the upgrades added to the Litecoin blockchain were subsequently added to the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>

<p>These upgrades include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SEGWIT, which reduces the amount of data in each block and allows the blockchain to process more transactions per second.</li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/segwit.PNG" />
</center>

<ul>
  <li>The Lightning Network, which makes it possible to create a payment channel, where multiple transactions can be sent between 2 parties for a fraction of the cost.</li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/lightnet.PNG" />
</center>

<ul>
  <li>Atomic Swaps, cross smart contracts, that make it possible to trade different cryptocurrencies directly peer-to-peer.</li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/atomswap.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="mimblewimble">MIMBLEWIMBLE</h2>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/mimble.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The next tech to be added to the Litecoin blockchain is a privacy protocol called <strong>MimbleWimble</strong>.</p>

<p>Any harry potter fans watching will know that MimbleWimble is the tongue-tying curse that scrambles a person’s speech</p>

<p>The MimbleWimble privacy protocol was proposed by an anonymous developer in 2018, and it’s the same protocol used by the GRIN privacy coin.</p>

<p><strong>How MimbleWimble works is that, it hides the wallet addresses involved in the transaction.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Only the total amount transacted between them can be seen.</strong></p>

<p>The Litecoin Foundation commissioned a GRIN developer to code MimbleWimble for Litecoin.</p>

<p>This code was completed in March and is currently being audited in preparation for implementation.</p>

<h2 id="extension-block">EXTENSION BLOCK</h2>

<p>In contrast to privacy coins like GRIN, privacy will be optional on the Litecoin blockchain.</p>

<p>This will be possible thanks to another technology called <strong>Extension Blocks</strong>.</p>

<p>At the conceptual level, you can think of Extension Blocks as being a side chain, or layer 2 for Litecoin.</p>

<p>If you want your Litecoin transactions to be private, you can send your LTC to the MimbleWimble extension chain that runs parallel to the Litecoin blockchain, and transact on it instead.</p>

<h2 id="even-though-it-may-be-more-private-there-shouldnt-be-an-issue-with-it-unlike-privacy-coins">EVEN THOUGH IT MAY BE MORE PRIVATE THERE SHOULDNT BE AN ISSUE WITH IT UNLIKE PRIVACY COINS</h2>

<p>The cool thing about Litecoin’s MimbleWimble implementation is the small amount of data it handles, when sending a transaction.</p>

<p>Means, it could double Litecoin’s TPS when transacting in private.</p>

<p>Moreover, exchanges are not obligated to support the MimbleWimble chain, meaning there shouldn’t be any risks of LTC getting delisted, the same way other privacy coins have been in recent months.</p>

<h2 id="why-ltc-goes-up-recent-events">WHY LTC GOES UP? RECENT EVENTS</h2>

<p>Now, speaking of LTC, it recently surpassed its previous all-time high of $310 and is showing no signs of slowing down.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/5.PNG" />
</center>

<p>This is for many reasons.</p>

<p>For starters, LTC is one of the four cryptocurrencies Paypal announced, it would be supporting in October last year.</p>

<p>More recently, Paypal announced that it will be allowing US customers to pay for goods and services using crypto, which includes LTC.</p>

<p>LTC can already be used to pay for goods and services in the United States via the Litecoin Visa debit card, introduced by the Litecoin foundation last summer.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/6.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Oddly enough, Flair Network also recently announced that it would be air dropping its SPARK token to LTC holders.</p>

<p>Now, for those unfamiliar, Flair Network is a cryptocurrency project funded by Ripple’s investment Arm, that’s looking to add smart contract functionality to XRP.</p>

<p>It seems they’re looking to do the same for LTC.</p>

<h2 id="institutional-interest">INSTITUTIONAL INTEREST</h2>

<p>In addition to retail investors, LTC has also seen its fair share of institutional interest over the last few months.</p>

<p>Most of this money has come through Greyscale’s Litecoin Trust, which apparently bought up 80% of all the LTC mind in February.</p>

<p>Institutional demand for LTC has been so high, that they have been paying a whopping 18x premium for exposure via Grayscale’s Litecoin Trust.</p>

<p>Now, according to Charlie Lee, Greyscale alone is likely holding more than 3% of all the LTC in circulation.</p>

<p>And that was back in March.</p>

<p>In April, Litecoin ETPs started trading on stock exchanges in Germany and Switzerland, both of which are physically backed.</p>

<p>I.e., the issuer of the ETP has to buy an equivalent amount of LTC to top it all off.</p>

<p>Many expert investors believe that retail traders were converting their Dogecoin profits into Litecoin on Robinhood.</p>

<p>This is the apparent driver behind LTC’s most recent price pump.</p>

<h2 id="how-high-can-ltc-go">HOW HIGH CAN LTC GO?</h2>

<p>How high LTC could go? Well, this really depends on BTC.</p>

<p>If BTC pulls a 2 or 3x, we would eventually see a similar move for most large cap alts, including LTC.</p>

<p>Compared to other popular cryptocurrencies, LTC has the edge, when it comes to tokenomics.</p>

<p>A maximum supply with a low emission, no pre-mine, and an equitable coin distribution.</p>

<p>Charlie Lee also claims, that he still doesn’t hold any LTC beyond what he needs for testing things, like new payment methods and MimbleWimble.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there’s no way of knowing for sure, because Charlie has not made his wallet address public like Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin has.</p>

<h2 id="will-not-be-a-payment-top-due-to-its-competition">WILL NOT BE A PAYMENT TOP DUE TO ITS COMPETITION</h2>

<p>In contrast to other top cryptos, Litecoin has a pretty limited use case, and is nowhere near close to being a top performer in its payments niche.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/7.jpg" />
</center>

<p>For now, LTC is the 15th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and it could have moving any further up the ranks.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/8.PNG" />
</center>

<p>This is because there are dozens of seriously legit smart contract cryptocurrencies, that are building out massive ecosystems, and those that haven’t already surpassed LTC, probably will in due course.</p>

<p>Still, assuming BTC does pull a 2 or 3x, we could see LTC hitting a thousand dollars, by the end of this bull market.</p>

<p>There is a small possibility it could go much higher than that, and this depends on what happens with Litecoin’s implementation of MimbleWimble.</p>

<h2 id="can-go-brrrrr-as-a-privacy-coin">CAN GO BRRRRR AS A PRIVACY COIN</h2>

<p>When Litecoin implements MimbleWimble, it will become a part of cryptocurrency’s privacy payments niche, which has much less competition.</p>

<p>The problem here is that, regulators are not a fan of total privacy, and this is why many exchanges have delisted Monero, ZCash and other privacy-preserving cryptos.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/9.PNG" />
</center>

<p>While Litecoin’s implementation of MimbleWimble might make it immune to the same scrutiny, as a standard privacy coin, it could draw the attention of regulators for other reasons.</p>

<p>LTC is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies on the dark web already.</p>

<p>Primarily due to low transaction fees, fast transaction times, and no lengthy wallet synchronization like Monero.</p>

<p>Not only that, but LTC is one of the easiest cryptocurrencies to get hold of, in addition to being on Paypal, Robinhood, and the Revolut banking app.</p>

<p>There are over 15 000 LTC ATMs around the world.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/10.PNG" />
</center>

<p>To put things into context, that’s about the same, or possibly even more than the amount of Bitcoin ATMs out there.</p>

<p>Not all of these ATMs require personal identification, and many of them allow you to buy and sell crypto using cash as well.</p>

<p>Taken together this means, that when Litecoin adds support for MimbleWimble, LTC could unironically become one of the best privacy preserving currencies on the planet.</p>

<p>This is an insanely bullish case for LTC.</p>

<p>But the regulatory backlash could crush that momentum overnight, so this begs the question: <em>why the hell are institutions buying so much Litecoin?</em></p>

<h2 id="why-institutions-buy-ltc">WHY INSTITUTIONS BUY LTC?</h2>

<p>There might be a few reasons.</p>

<p>For starters, there’s that <strong>recognizability and branding.</strong></p>

<p>Litecoin is everywhere and it’s been around for a long time.</p>

<p>The idea, that LTC is silver, and BTC is gold, is a hard one to kill.</p>

<p>Many institutional investors, who are paying attention in 2017, probably remember the classic BTC, ETH, LTC combo, even if this is their first encounter.</p>

<p>With crypto, the fact that Litecoin tends to follow Bitcoin wherever it goes, means LTC constantly gets exposure and validation.</p>

<p>As controversial, as privacy is, institutions seem to be big fans of it, so much so, that Grayscale is trying to put together a Monero Trust.</p>

<p>This actually makes a lot of sense, when you think about it.</p>

<p>If you have millions of dollars in crypto, would you want your friends, family, clients or customers to see your wallet balance every time you make a transaction?</p>

<p>After all, if the government phases out all the cash and kills privacy, how will all the big banks and businesses continue to engage in “<em>extracurricular activities</em>”?</p>

<h2 id="ltc-github-reddit-twitter-and-overall-whats-going-on-with-it">LTC GITHUB, REDDIT, TWITTER AND OVERALL WHATS GOING ON WITH IT</h2>

<p>Besides MimbleWimble, Litecoin doesn’t seem to have much else on the horizon, and an actual date for implementation has not yet been set.</p>

<p>Like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Litecoin is open source, and anyone can submit a Litecoin Improvement Proposal or LIP.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, there are only three LIPs, and the two, that are yet to be enacted, relate to MimbleWimble.</p>

<p>What’s even more concerning is that, the Litecoin github has seen next to 0 activity in recent months.</p>

<p>However, this seems to be because most of the activity is taking place on the Litecoin Talk Forum, which has been incredibly active as of late.</p>

<p>A core developers also seem to be quite active on Reddit, and one of them recently noted, that they’re in the process of putting together a concrete roadmap.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/litecoin/11.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Flair Network is also scheduled to airdrop its SPARK token to light coiners in June, and this could turn Litecoin into a hotbed of new decentralized applications.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the Litecoin Foundation is working on creating new partnerships and expanding LTC’s use cases.</p>

<h2 id="best-qualities">BEST QUALITIES</h2>

<p>I predict, that we will see many more bullish announcements about Litecoin in the coming months, and these will continue to carry LTC to new all-time highs.</p>

<p>On paper, Litecoin is one of the best cryptocurrencies on the market.</p>

<p><strong>It has all four qualities that were mentioned in the introduction:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a use case as a medium of payment,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>super robust tokenomics,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>global awareness and adoption,</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>and the best slogan in crypto: <em>the silver to Bitcoin’s gold</em>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Litecoin was also built by an insanely smart developer, and continues to improve over time.</p>

<h2 id="but-theres-something-alarming">BUT THERE’S SOMETHING ALARMING</h2>

<p>In practice though, Litecoin seems to be lacking in more than one department.</p>

<p>For one, transparency has not been its strong suit, and there’s no question, that Charlie selling his LTC back in 2017 was very bad optics for the project.</p>

<p>It’s possible that Charlie was legitimately concerned about accusations of price manipulation by the likes of the SEC.</p>

<p>This is what’s happening to Elon Musk right now, because of Dogecoin.</p>

<p>But the difference is that, Elon Musk has more than enough money to make that problem go away.</p>

<p>His infamous 420 Tesla tweet being a prime example.</p>

<h2 id="partnership-with-flair-network">PARTNERSHIP WITH FLAIR NETWORK</h2>

<p>Seeing how active Charlie has been in his advocacy of Litecoin is a good sign, but still, there seems to be more than meets the eye.</p>

<p>For example, it’s possible that Flair Network’s decision to airdrop its SPARK token to Litecoin holders was orchestrated by the Litecoin Foundation.</p>

<p>Charlie has noted on multiple occasions, that he’s usually the one, who pens these sort of deals, and he is consequently the first one to know about them.</p>

<p>This deal was a win-win for both parties, since Flair Network can argue it’s not building exclusively for Ripple if the SEC comes knocking, and the price of LTC will appreciate thanks to the additional use case.</p>

<h2 id="overall-more-pluses">OVERALL MORE PLUSES</h2>

<p>Moreover, as hard as the Litecoin devs are apparently working, it seems like most of the heavy lifting is being done by other devs they paid.</p>

<p>I.e, the GRIN guy for MimbleWimble.</p>

<p>Conversely, you could argue that this slow pace of development is necessary, when dealing with developments such as these.</p>

<p>Litecoins development has still been much faster than Bitcoins, and this might be yet another reason, why institutions are so keen on Litecoin.</p>

<p>Litecoin has the unofficial title of Bitcoin’s test net, and this would logically make it valuable to institutions, that are investing heavily in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>It also means, that we could see private BTC transactions in the next year or two.</p>

<p><strong>As many questions as there are around Litecoin, one thing is for certain: so long as governments keep printing money, cryptos with robust tokenomics will continue to grow, and that includes Litecoin.</strong></p>

<h2 id="deflation-in-japan">DEFLATION IN JAPAN</h2>

<p>The risk of inflation in March 2020 was worrying.</p>

<p>The excess monetary stimulus, that was being thrown at the markets, and the impact that this would have, once the lockdowns eased was concerning.</p>

<p>Some said, that inflation concerns were misguided, that deflation was the more likely scenario.</p>

<p>This was the main narrative, that was coming from the FED.</p>

<p>They were really concerned about a Japanese-style deflationary and stagnating economy, hence the reason that they flooded the system with money.</p>

<h2 id="printing-money-and-plans-to-keep-the-inflation-at-2">PRINTING MONEY AND PLANS TO KEEP THE INFLATION AT 2%</h2>

<p>However, that was in 2020, and things have progressed at a lightning pace.</p>

<p>Money printing continued through the rest of the year, as countries tried to stave off incoming second and third waves.</p>

<p>However, as vaccines started to roll out, and lockdowns were slowly being lifted, things began to change.</p>

<p>The FED was hoping to keep the market tethered to its inflation average target of below 2%.</p>

<p>Paul and CO said, that they didn’t have any fears of inflation, and as such, would not be tightening monetary policy anytime soon.</p>

<h5 id="commodities-and-price-rises">COMMODITIES AND PRICE RISES</h5>

<p>This was despite some of the warning signs. that were coming through the data commodity.</p>

<p>Prices were starting to surge across the board.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Economy/inflation/dan.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Back in April those were the price increases, that we were seeing for some of these commodities.</p>

<p>As we know, commodities are used as raw materials for other goods and services.</p>

<p>It was inevitable, that we would start to see these price increases work their way through the rest of the economy.</p>

<p>Fuel prices have been on the rise since the beginning of the year, and house prices have been skyrocketing a combination of demand and lumber shortages.</p>

<p>So inflation was already beginning to rear its head, and there were many market participants, who were beginning to ring the alarm bells.</p>

<h2 id="the-surprising-outcome---inflation">THE “SURPRISING” OUTCOME - INFLATION</h2>

<p>Then came the April CPI numbers.</p>

<p>They showed, that consumer prices had increased by 4.2% in the 12 months from April 2020.</p>

<p>That’s a full 2.2% above the FED target and even higher, than some economists were predicting.</p>

<p>It was also the highest CPI print since 2009.</p>

<p>Needless to say, it took the market by surprise, and led to a jump in long-term bond yields, and a fall in stock and crypto prices.</p>

<h2 id="ppi---producer-price-inflation">PPI - PRODUCER PRICE INFLATION</h2>

<p>Things didn’t get that much better, when a day later the US PPI numbers came in.</p>

<p><strong>Producer Price Inflation is a measure of the prices, that companies pay for the inputs of the goods, that they use in their production.</strong></p>

<p>These were up over 6.2% in April, and it was the largest increase in the PPI measure, since they started tracking it back in 2010.</p>

<p>There was also a 0.6% increase in the PPI in just one month from March.</p>

<p><strong>What did the FED expect, when they printed 25% of all the money ever in existence in a single year?</strong></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Economy/inflation/money-supply.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="why-inflation-is-deadly">WHY INFLATION IS DEADLY</h2>

<p>There are a number of reasons, as to why inflation is so deadly.</p>

<p><strong>In failed states inflation is the general increase in the price of goods and services.</strong></p>

<p>In a country it’s a broad measure of how much the cost of living has increased over time.</p>

<p>An increase in prices is not terrible, as long as it’s measured and in line with expectations, as well as increasing incomes.</p>

<p>However, when it is running above expectations, then it can lead to further inflation, as people increase their prices to match their expectations.</p>

<p>Persistent and high inflation is also detrimental to savers, as it means that the dollars, that they hold in their bank account are worth less today, than they were a year ago.</p>

<h2 id="inflation-and-investors">INFLATION AND INVESTORS</h2>

<p>And it’s not just individuals, that suffer the impact of higher inflation.</p>

<p>Think about all those institutional investors, that have to try and get an attractive real rate of return on their funds.</p>

<p>With a higher rate of inflation their dollar-denominated returns are less.</p>

<p>Or how about corporates?</p>

<p>When a corporate keeps cash on its balance sheet in order to fund its treasury management activities, that cash is depreciating at the rate of inflation.</p>

<p>This is a destruction of shareholder value, and means, that these companies will have fewer funds to invest in operations in the future.</p>

<p>In fact, it could be worse for corporate balance sheets than consumers.</p>

<h2 id="cpi-consumption">CPI CONSUMPTION</h2>

<p>PPI, which is a production measure, was running hotter than CPI consumption.</p>

<p>The cost of inputs for companies is running higher, which means, that dollars saved on balance sheets, are worth that much less.</p>

<h2 id="impact-on-the-us-dollar">IMPACT ON THE US DOLLAR</h2>

<p>But that’s not even the worst part about inflation. You have to consider the impact, that it has on the US dollar.</p>

<p>More broadly, the US dollar is the world’s reserve currency, which means, that a great deal of it is held offshore.</p>

<p>It’s estimated, that between 40-70% of all US dollar bank notes in circulation, are held outside of US borders.</p>

<p>Then you have all those foreign central banks, that don’t only hold US dollars, but also dollar denominated debt.</p>

<p>The more value that the dollar loses each year, the more likely these central banks and foreign holders are to diversify their currency risk.</p>

<p>Of course, any selling by offshore holders devalues the US dollar relative to other currencies.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Economy/inflation/chart.jpg" />
</center>

<p>This chart here shows the US dollar index over the past month.</p>

<p>As visible, in May it’s been trending down recently, and is near the lowest levels, that we’ve seen this year.</p>

<p>When the US dollar devalues relative to other currencies, it also makes the cost of imports that much more expensive, which of course adds to the inflation equation.</p>

<p>The point is that inflation is toxic and should be avoided.</p>

<p>It’s also one of those things, that are hard to reign back in again.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Economy/inflation/dxy.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="cpi-inflation---cpi-basket">CPI INFLATION - CPI BASKET</h2>

<p>The CPI inflation itself is vastly underestimating the true inflation.</p>

<p><strong>The main point of contention here comes down to the basket of goods and services used to measure the CPI.</strong></p>

<p>Basically the CPI measure is under counting inflation, because of the fact that the bureau of labor statistics adjusts the composition of the goods and services in that basket between two time periods.</p>

<p>Instead of looking at the price of the same goods and services between the two periods, it accounts for substitution and quality changes.</p>

<p>It assumes that consumers adjust behavior, and hence it means, that the composition of the basket has to change.</p>

<p>The main point to take away from this is that, they are not really comparing apples with apples, and it’s not only that you should consider.</p>

<h2 id="what-did-they-not-include-in-their-reports---pandemic-outcome">WHAT DID THEY NOT INCLUDE IN THEIR REPORTS - PANDEMIC OUTCOME</h2>

<p><strong>The fact that the basket used to determine this CPI does not include assets such as investment assets.</strong></p>

<p><strong>It does not include housing prices, even though these play a large part in the cost of living conundrum.</strong></p>

<p>There’s no need to tell about how quickly the cost of housing has been going up recently.</p>

<p>Then one has to consider, how much consumption patterns have changed in the wake of the pandemic and think about what was purchased, and what was not.</p>

<p>In the wake of the lockdowns, travel and leisure completely collapsed.</p>

<p>The only items, that people spent more on, were groceries and booze, both of which make sense.</p>

<p>In the words of IMF economist Marshall Reinstorf “<em>Spending patterns changed abruptly, and the CPI weight suddenly became obsolete.”</em></p>

<p>Apart from this, most shopping went online, where the price fluctuation can be a lot more rapid and volatile.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Economy/inflation/inflat.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="incorrect-data">INCORRECT DATA</h2>

<p>Not only that, but because of this, shift data collection of the prices of goods services in the basket was hard to do.</p>

<p>Researchers could not visit physical stores in order to gather that price data.</p>

<p>This means, that the cost of living over the past year has been much higher, than we’re being led to believe based on the CPI data.</p>

<p>One more interesting chart, that you can look at, is this one by economist <em>Alberto Cavall</em>, which shows a different covert basket, which is running considerably hotter than the actual CPI basket.</p>

<p>We don’t need a CPI measure to tell, how much prices have gone up over the past year, and what’s even more disconcerting about all of this is the fact, that most employers determine salary increases based on these official figures.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-protect-ourselves-from-inflation---invest-in-things-of-limited-supply">HOW TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM INFLATION? - INVEST IN THINGS OF LIMITED SUPPLY</h2>

<p>How do you protect yourself from this upcoming inflation?</p>

<p>The best hedges against inflation are those, that have a limited supply.</p>

<p>Those, that cannot easily be devalued by increasing the amount of supply in circulation.</p>

<p>Traditionally, these have been hard assets, like gold, which are perceived to have a limited supply, as well as fundamental use cases, as in jewellery, etc.</p>

<h2 id="gold-should-be-the-saltvation-but-there-was-no-hedge">GOLD SHOULD BE THE SALTVATION. BUT THERE WAS NO HEDGE..?</h2>

<p>However, if we take a look at the performance of gold over the past year, it’s been relatively meager.</p>

<p>You would have thought, that the world’s premier reserve asset would have been breaking new all-time highs this year.</p>

<p>This has not been the case, but there is another inflation hedge, that has been doing just that, and that is of course <strong>Bitcoin</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Economy/inflation/7.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="bitcoin---limited-supply">BITCOIN - LIMITED SUPPLY</h2>

<p>The reason that Bitcoin is seen as such an effective inflation hedge, is because it has a hard defined limit of 21 million.</p>

<p>There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin mined.</p>

<p>Fun fact, there are currently 51 million dollar millionaires in the world, so if each of them wanted some Bitcoin, there is not enough to go around for each to even have half a Bitcoin.</p>

<p>This is not even counting the fact, that at least 20% of Bitcoin has been lost forever.</p>

<h2 id="decreasing-emission-schedule">DECREASING EMISSION SCHEDULE</h2>

<p>Another supply factor, that you have to consider is the fact, that Bitcoin has a decreasing emission schedule.</p>

<p>Its inflation rate keeps on falling and approaches 0 over time.</p>

<p>Now, there are many more qualities, that make Bitcoin more favorable to gold as an asset to store wealth.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin inflation hedge trade has been taken on by numerous institutional investors.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Economy/inflation/8.PNG" />
</center>

<h5 id="investors-that-converted-to-bitcoin-cult">INVESTORS THAT CONVERTED TO BITCOIN CULT</h5>

<p>For example, one of the most prolific global macro investors is <em>Paul Tudor Jones</em>, and last year he wrote this paper on the great monetary inflation quite simply.</p>

<p>It talked about the impact, that money printing would have on asset markets, and why he was investing in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>There are also likes of Stanley Druckenmiller, one of the most well-known Forex traders in the world.</p>

<p>He was also raising the alarm bells around this incoming USD inflation, and the implications, this could have on the Bitcoin markets.</p>

<p>He even went a step further and claimed, that cryptocurrency like Bitcoin could one day replace the US dollar as a global reserve asset.</p>

<p>Or how about Bill Miller, the storied value investor behind the Leg Mason Opportunity fund?</p>

<p>He basically pointed out in a Q4 market update, that if inflation were to pick up, then corporates would be allocating a larger proportion of their balance sheet towards Bitcoin.</p>

<p>“<em>Trickle would turn into a torrent, and that trickle has already started</em>”.</p>

<h2 id="companies-that-invested-in-btc">COMPANIES THAT INVESTED IN BTC</h2>

<p>There is a number of companies, that have been allocating a portion of their treasury positions towards Bitcoin.</p>

<p>These of course include the likes of Microstrategy, Square, Tesla, MeToo and Acre, to name but a few.</p>

<p>Now, these companies all allocated to Bitcoin, as they were worried about the impact, that the inflation would have on their long-term shareholder value, and as Bill Miller stated, this trickle is likely to become a Torrent.</p>

<p>That is because of the sheer number of companies, that are concerned about the impact of inflation.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Economy/inflation/9.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The chart above shows, the percentage increase in the average mentions of the word “<em>inflation</em>” by 26 S&amp;P 500 companies in their earnings calls.</p>

<p>Clearly, the concern is on their mind, and this was even before we had those high CPI and PPI prints 2 weeks ago.</p>

<p>You can bet your bottom dollar, that these will be up yet again in the next round of earnings calls.</p>

<h2 id="why-bitcoin-fell">WHY BITCOIN FELL?</h2>

<p>Bitcoin is seen as a premier inflation hedge, so why did it fall the day of that CPI print?</p>

<p>Surely, it should have rallied.</p>

<p>There is a lot more going on here.</p>

<h2 id="fed-comes-in-and-increases-interest-rates">FED COMES IN AND INCREASES INTEREST RATES</h2>

<p>When the CPI prints came in 2 weeks ago and took the markets by surprise, the main concern was not really the actual inflation itself, but what it meant for interest rates.</p>

<p>You see, the market is aware of the fact, that the FED has a set inflation target of 2% earlier this year.</p>

<p>The FED was giving guidance that it would not be loosening monetary policy this year.</p>

<p>In fact, the FED was hoping to keep the average inflation below the percent target until at least 2023.</p>

<p>Therefore, with such a high print above the inflation target, it means, that the FED has had its hand forced.</p>

<p>It will need to increase interest rates in order to rein back in that money and stop the economy from overheating.</p>

<p>Of course, higher interest rates have large implications.</p>

<p>For nearly every asset class out there, including Bitcoin, we saw this more recently, when the secretary of the treasury caused an interest rate scare with her comments about monetary tightening.</p>

<h2 id="correlation-between-fund-rate-and-btc">CORRELATION BETWEEN FUND RATE AND BTC</h2>

<p>Why does a higher FED’s fund rate impact on Bitcoin?</p>

<p>This is because despite Bitcoin being a long-term hedge for inflation, it is still viewed as a risk-on asset.</p>

<p>These are assets, that are generally riskier, and which investors are happy to allocate their funds to in a low rates environment assets that are more risk-off, include bonds and cash.</p>

<p>These of course yield much more when rates go up.</p>

<p>When rates go up, the discount rate used to calculate future cash flows goes up, which means a lower present stock value.</p>

<p>But that is neither here nor there.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Economy/inflation/10.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="because-its-a-risky-asset---investors-stick-to-smth-safer">BECAUSE ITS A RISKY ASSET - INVESTORS STICK TO SMTH SAFER</h2>

<p>The point is that, in an environment with rising rates, risk on assets tend to underperform.</p>

<p>Given that Bitcoin is seen as one of the riskiest assets in the risky bucket, it will naturally also suffer from this.</p>

<p>There is statistical evidence.</p>

<p>You only need to take a look at the correlation between the price of equities and crypto.</p>

<p>In 2020, there was the highest correlation between the two factors since data has been tracked.</p>

<p>Given the report by the people at Van Eck:</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Economy/inflation/13.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Given this analysis, there was almost no correlation between them in the years prior, whereas last year it was statistically significant.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Economy/inflation/14.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Here’s another chart, that shows the correlation as a graph.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Economy/inflation/15.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Over time it’s a clear uptrend from mildly negative in 2017, to moderately positive this year.</p>

<h2 id="not-hedge-for-stock-market-volatility">NOT HEDGE FOR STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY</h2>

<p>From all the available evidence, it appears that Bitcoin is not really a hedge for stock market volatility.</p>

<p>It is placed in the same bucket, and will hence rise and fall.</p>

<h2 id="correlated-with-stocks---hence-sensitive-to-interest-rate">CORRELATED WITH STOCKS - HENCE SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATE</h2>

<p>Bitcoin is correlated with stocks, and is hence sensitive to interest rate hikes.</p>

<p>However, inflation is much more pervasive, and unlike the FED’s fund rate, it is hard as hell to control.</p>

<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is not a cash flow based asset like stocks.</p>

<p>It’s an asset, that has completely different characteristics and use cases.</p>

<p>Its correlation to stocks is more of a short-term phenomenon, as these institutional investors adjust their portfolios.</p>

<p>It’s unlikely to be a long-term trend, and as such, it’s likely to think, that Bitcoin will become less responsive to rate hike fears, just the way it was intended.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>In 2020 in response to the pandemic, governments seem to have thrown the baby out with the bath water, and that water is now flooding the streets leaving them awash with cash.</p>

<p>It’s even more worrying now, than it was last year, and if the recent CPI prints and stock route is anything to go by the fear has become real.</p>

<p>It’s not Venezuela or Zimbabwe levels of inflation, but it’s alarming for many of the reasons that were highlighted earlier.</p>

<p>These inflationary concerns are having two contradictory effects on the markets in the short term.</p>

<p>They’re causing panic because of the fears, that they could lead to a FED tapering.</p>

<p>The markets have become drunk on the free money, that has been raining down on them, and they are now worried, that the FED’s founding may slow to a trickle.</p>

<p>These fears have also led to a sell-off in Bitcoin, but this is likely to only be temporary.</p>

<p>The inflation narrative is likely to be that much more pervasive and last for quite some time.</p>

<p>This is because it’s a lot harder to rein it in without seriously damaging the economy.</p>

<p>In this climate, it will be hard for people companies and institutions to preserve their investments and purchasing power going forward.</p>

<p>Bitcoin really is the digital gold that they have been looking for.</p>

<p>Limited supply, decreasing inflation rate, easy to transport and store in the turbulent sea of rising prices, it really will be the lifeboat sent from above to rescue you from decreasing purchasing power.</p>

<p>All praise to Satoshi.</p>

<h2 id="tokenizing-sport">TOKENIZING SPORT</h2>

<p>The team at Chiliz is all about tokenizing the sports and entertainment sectors by creating a fan engagement platform.</p>

<p>Yes, that does sound great, but why on Earth would anyone want to do that, in the first place?</p>

<p>It’s pretty sure that everyone has at least a passing interest in sports. But the deal is:</p>

<h2 id="a-mere-fan-cant-make-a-decision-on-his-team-unless">A MERE FAN CAN’T MAKE A DECISION ON HIS TEAM… UNLESS?</h2>

<p>Sports fans can only really watch their team, buy the merch, and buy overpriced match day treats.</p>

<p>In essence, we’re all passive sports content consumers, and have no active influence over what happens with the team.</p>

<p>Actually, maybe most <em>normal</em> people like are passive sports content consumers.</p>

<p>It is true, that if you’re a billionaire, like Sheikh Mansour, you might decide to buy a football team like Manchester City.</p>

<p>But for other people, there are almost no systems in place to influence their team’s decisions, which is annoying for fans, when their manager or coach makes some silly decision.</p>

<p>Chiliz basically aims to solve that problem by giving fans a say in their team’s management, as well, as a new way to engage with their team.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-players-and-teams-agree-to-this">WHY WOULD PLAYERS AND TEAMS AGREE TO THIS?</h2>

<p>It’s pretty cool, but why would a sports team want to give fans a say?</p>

<p>Surely there are a ton of highly paid bigwigs, that would be out of a job.</p>

<p>Well, the teams dictate the decisions that fans can influence, so some teams might not want to crowdsource that team sheet every day, which is understandable.</p>

<p>Most sports teams out there are businesses, and that means they need to make money.</p>

<p>Those star players don’t tend to play for free after all.</p>

<p>Those key income streams would be TV rights deals, merchandise sales, and gate receipts.</p>

<p>And the truth is that gate receipts have been harsh on most sports teams over the last year.</p>

<p>However, a key way to further grow that team income, would be through opening up new ways to monetize those fans, and that’s the value proposition that Chiliz offers these sports teams, by allowing them to sell fans the right to vote on specific team decisions.</p>

<p>A form of radical fan engagement, if you will.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/1.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="win-win-for-fans-and-teams">WIN-WIN FOR FANS AND TEAMS</h2>

<p>Put simply, Chiliz offers the solution for teams to gamify team management, turn it into an entertainment proposition in its own right, and monetize the demand for these voting rights.</p>

<p>Fans on the other hand get a new way to support their team, and get given the opportunity to vote on certain team decisions, all of which impact on real world sporting events.</p>

<p>So that’s a win for the team, and for the fans, who like the idea of that opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="chiliz-ecosystem">CHILIZ ECOSYSTEM</h2>

<p>There are two key platforms that make up Chiliz.</p>

<p>The first would be <em>socios.com</em>, which is that team crowd management platform.</p>

<p>This empowers fans to take an active role in guiding various decisions, and have an influence on events for their favorite sports teams.</p>

<p>That’s all made possible by blockchain-based Fan Tokens, which allowed for secure and trustless deployment of tokenized voting rights, all executed by smart contracts on the <em>socios</em> platform.</p>

<p>So, on the <em>socios</em> app you might want to buy a Fan Token for Juventus Football Club, which would give you voting rights for certain club decisions.</p>

<p>However, those Fan Tokens also act a bit like loyalty cards, by giving you access to merchandise discounts and unique experiences.</p>

<p>That could include things like exclusive dugout access on matchdays, or getting your hands on a signed shirt from your sporting hero.</p>

<p>What’s also important to note, is that, every sports team listed on the app has its own unique Fan Token.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/1.5.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="socioscom---key-functionalities">SOCIOS.COM - KEY FUNCTIONALITIES</h2>

<p>Basically, the <em>socios</em> app has 7 key features active right now.</p>

<h5 id="1-buy-crypto">1. BUY CRYPTO</h5>

<p>The first is that, <strong>it acts as a type of fiat on-ramp into crypto</strong>.</p>

<p>You can buy Chiliz tokens via the app using <em>Mastercard</em>, <em>Visa</em>, <em>Skrill</em> and <em>Rapid</em>.</p>

<p>You’ll need Chiliz tokens to acquire the Fan Tokens for your favorite team.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/3.PNG" />
</center>

<h5 id="2-buy-sell-fan-coins">2. BUY-SELL FAN COINS</h5>

<p>Next, there’s a trading section that allows you to buy and sell those Fan Tokens.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/a.png" style="max-height: 600px" />
</center>

<h5 id="3-voting">3. VOTING</h5>

<p>Then you have that all-important voting function for those that own Fan Tokens.</p>

<p><strong>This allows you to vote on things like shirt designs, the name for training grounds, and more.</strong></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/b.png" style="max-height: 600px" />
</center>

<p>Cypriot first division side Apollon FC kind of took the concept of fan engagement to the next level.</p>

<p>In a friendly match against their rivals, the team sheet and formation were picked by their fans, using <em>socios</em>.</p>

<p>It turns out, that the fans clearly knew a thing or two with Apollon FC emerging as 6:0 victors in that match.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/5.PNG" />
</center>

<h5 id="4-rewards-for-holding-crypto---discounts-etc">4. REWARDS FOR HOLDING CRYPTO - DISCOUNTS, ETC</h5>

<p>Some of the current benefits you can access through the app, if you hold enough Fan Tokens, are things like a 20% discount on the merchandise from certain teams.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/c.png" style="max-height: 600px" />
</center>

<h5 id="5-earning-reward-tokens">5. EARNING REWARD TOKENS</h5>

<p>You can also earn reward tokens by engaging with the app, which you can redeem for exclusive club goodies.</p>

<h5 id="6-pokemon-go">6. POKEMON GO</h5>

<p>And another game in the app is socios version of <em>Pokemon Go</em>.</p>

<p>In short, you can chase down those Fan and Chiliz tokens in the real world via an augmented reality feature in the app.</p>

<p>Find those coins and you can get some of them for free.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/e.png" style="max-height: 600px" />
</center>

<h5 id="7-the-locker-room">7. THE LOCKER ROOM</h5>

<p>And finally, you can get access to something called the <strong>locker room</strong>.</p>

<p>This will be covered in a bit.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/d.png" style="max-height: 600px" />
</center>

<h2 id="supported-sports">SUPPORTED SPORTS</h2>

<p>In terms of supported sports on the app, right now the focus is on football.</p>

<p>However, some esports and basketball teams are involved with, MMA coming soon too.</p>

<p>What’s interesting is that, this model of gamification can be replicated in almost any other sports vertical.</p>

<p>So the potential here is truly massive.</p>

<h2 id="chiliz-exchange">CHILIZ EXCHANGE</h2>

<p>The second element of the Chiliz ecosystem would be the Chiliz Exchange.</p>

<p>The main draw here is all the Fan Token trading pairs, which have CHZ trading pairs only.</p>

<p>There are a few other regular crypto trading pairs, like CHZ-USDT, or CHZ-BTC, but the main focus is on trading those Fan Tokens.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/6.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Also do note, that if you want to get your hands on some Chiliz or Fan Tokens, this is going to be the cheapest exchange to buy them.</p>

<p><strong>Basically, if you’re using the CHZ trading pair to buy on the exchange, you’ll be paying 0% in fees.</strong></p>

<p>Exchange fees to sell on CHZ trading pairs are 0.6%, with other pairs being charged at 0.2% in fees.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/7.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="what-teams-have-partnered-up-with-socios-so-far">WHAT TEAMS HAVE PARTNERED UP WITH SOCIOS SO FAR?</h2>

<p>It’s obvious that many crypto veterans will be jaded by partnership announcements, which generally turn out to be nothing special or a pure scam.</p>

<p>To be fair, there are still plenty of those happening in the crypto space today, so it’s pretty reasonable.</p>

<p>The idea of Chiliz partnering up with the likes of Barcelona, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Atletico, Madrid, and AC Milan is nothing but false promises.</p>

<p>However, those with a healthy dose of skepticism only need to look at these team’s social accounts, and you can find mentions of both Chiliz and <em>socios</em>.</p>

<p>These are some of the biggest football clubs in the world, with massive fan bases, and millions of Twitter followers.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/8.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="chiliz-tokens">CHILIZ TOKENS</h2>

<p>There are 4 types of Chiliz ecosystem tokens.</p>

<p>You have those <strong>Fan Tokens</strong>, which are issued for all sports teams partnering up with Chiliz on <em>socios</em>.</p>

<p>For each team a finite number of Fan Tokens are issued, with concrete voting rights, and the ability to unlock rewards and perks mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Fans get those voting rights by swapping Chiliz tokens for Fan Tokens, to gain decision-making rights for that team.</p>

<p><strong>So I might own a Juventus Fan Token, and that will only let me vote on Juventus related events.</strong></p>

<p>What’s super interesting here is that, these Fan Tokens have created yet another form of crypto backed fundraising - the <strong>Fan Token Offering (FTO)</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s how new partners are launched on the <em>socios.com</em> platform.</p>

<p>In short, a fixed price per Fan Token is agreed upon by <em>socios</em> and the team.</p>

<p>Then, a portion of the Fan Tokens are made available on the <em>socios</em> platform for fans to buy, and users can get them at a fixed price.</p>

<p>A bit like an ICO, IEO or IDO.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/9.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="whats-the-demand-for-such-a-token">WHAT’S THE DEMAND FOR SUCH A TOKEN?</h2>

<p>Here’s an interesting fact.</p>

<p>A recent FTO by AC Milan generated more than 6 million dollars in the first 30 minutes of launch.</p>

<p>So yes, there is some pretty crazy demand for these tokens.</p>

<p>However this is not a one-off thing.</p>

<p>In 2021 Chiliz claims, that Fan Tokens generated over 30 million dollars in revenue for sports teams and partners via FTOs in 2022.</p>

<p>Pretty handy for teams suffering from those low gate receipts due to the pandemic.</p>

<h2 id="token-burnings-incentive">TOKEN BURNINGS INCENTIVE</h2>

<p>Earlier in the year Chiliz announced Fan Token burn mechanisms.</p>

<p>Essentially, the better the team performs, and the more Fan Token holders there are, the fewer tokens that will be in circulation.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/10.png" />
</center>

<p>An example of that can be seen over here.</p>

<p>Let’s say, we hold the Barcelona Fan Tokens here.</p>

<p>20,000 of these Fan Tokens were burned per goal, and 40,000 were burned, if Barcelona won.</p>

<p>It is true, that football fans are maybe even more tribal, than the crypto community, and the demand for them seems to have been validated.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/11.jpg" />
</center>

<h2 id="tokenomics">TOKENOMICS</h2>

<p>Usually only a very small percentage of the total supply is circulating.</p>

<p>Take the Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token for example.</p>

<p>Just 6 of the 20 million total supply is circulating.</p>

<p>The rest of the tokens held by PSG Football Club have a linear vesting schedule of 8 years with 2.5 million being released per year.</p>

<p>That’s about double the current circulating supply.</p>

<p>There is surely going to be quite a bit of inflation.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/12.PNG" />
</center>

<p>After all, the same is true of Juventus Fan Tokens with just 1.3 million tokens circulating with a total supply of 20 million.</p>

<p>The rest of those Fan Tokens have that same monthly linear vesting schedule of 8 years with 2.5 million youth tokens being released every year.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/13.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Now, many sports fans don’t know about the importance of tokenomics.</p>

<p>They are likely to just buy those tokens because they like a certain team.</p>

<p>We all have friends, who are likely to be in that category.</p>

<h2 id="inflation-and-demand">INFLATION AND DEMAND</h2>

<p>So, the main question should be <em>“Will demand for fan tokens outstrip their pretty crazy inflation rate?”</em>.</p>

<p>If that’s the case, then we can expect the token price to increase.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in checking out all the different Fan Tokens and their perspective market caps, then you might want to check out <a href="https://fantokenrank.com/" target="_blank">fantokenrank.com</a>.</p>

<p>It’s basically like a <em>CoinMarketCap</em> for Fan Tokens only. Secondly you have the Chiliz or CHZ token.</p>

<h2 id="pay-attention-when-buying">PAY ATTENTION WHEN BUYING!</h2>

<p>Both an ERC-20 utility token and a BEP-2 token on the Binance Chain, so be sure not to mix things up, if you’re depositing or withdrawing from an exchange.</p>

<p>CHZ tokens are basically used as the fuel for the Chiliz ecosystem, and are used by fans to acquire those all-important Fan Tokens for any of the teams partnered with <em>socios.com</em>.</p>

<p>The way, we can think of them, is that they act in a similar way to ETH back in its crazy ICO days of 2017, except they’re for Fan Token Offerings.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/14.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="potential-future-plans-to-increase-demand">POTENTIAL FUTURE PLANS TO INCREASE DEMAND</h2>

<p>The next use case of the CHZ token hasn’t gone live yet, however, in the near future MMA fans will be able to buy UFC tickets with Chiliz tokens.</p>

<p>Chiliz will also be giving out VIP experiences for specific UFC events.</p>

<p>Those sorts of unique experiences could lead to an increase in demand for CHZ tokens.</p>

<p>That’s very unlinkely however to think, that Chiliz will expand similar options to sports teams partnered with the platform.</p>

<p>It’s also true, that CHZ can be used as a store, and transfer of value like every other cryptocurrency and they can be traded on exchanges.</p>

<h2 id="tokenomics-of-chz">TOKENOMICS OF CHZ</h2>

<p>There are not many recent information on the tokenomics, so we’ll have to use the outline from 2019.</p>

<p>That outlines that 20 of net trading fees on the Chiliz exchange will be burned, so will 10 of the net proceeds from FTOs and 20 of the proceeds from NFTs and collectibles.</p>

<p>That announcement for version 2.0 of Chiliz token economics states, that those terms for burning CHZ are valid till June 2020, when they’ll be reviewed.</p>

<p>Sadly, that’s impossible to find more recent information on that.</p>

<p>However, Chiliz did tweet earlier in 2021 that the first burn of the year was based on that token economics announcement, and that 11 million CHZ tokens had been sent to the incinerator.</p>

<p>That token burn was worth around 5.5 million dollars at the time of shooting this video.</p>

<p>Not too large an amount, given that the project commands a market cap of just over 2.5 billion.</p>

<h2 id="the-locker-room-tokens">THE LOCKER ROOM TOKENS</h2>

<p>The third type of Chiliz token would be <strong>Locker Tokens</strong>.</p>

<p>What are those?</p>

<p>In the <em>socios</em> app there’s a feature, called <em>the Socios Locker Room</em>.</p>

<p>Its purpose is to show potential partner clubs, how much demand there is for their team’s Fan Tokens.</p>

<p>It’s basically <em>socios</em> users saying “<em>Hey, Mr. Sports Club, we really want you to do a Fan Token with socios!</em>”.</p>

<p>The team at <em>socios</em> create a locker for each potential partner club.</p>

<p>These are open for 120 days.</p>

<p>Users can put CHZ tokens into the locker, and you get Locker Tokens in return.</p>

<p>If the partner decides to launch a Fan Token, then these Locker Tokens are swapped for official Fan Tokens at a rate of one to one.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-profit-from-locker-rooms">WHAT’S THE PROFIT FROM LOCKER ROOMS?</h2>

<p>But why bother with this? What’s the incentive?</p>

<p>If a potential partner doesn’t opt to launch their Fan Token in the specified time period, then you get your CHZ tokens back.</p>

<p>However, if the club does go ahead with that, you’ve secured your allocation of Fan Tokens, and you get 10% of the money you initially invested in.</p>

<p>Bonus CHZ cashback.</p>

<p>The interesting side effect of this Locker Room mechanic is that, it essentially replicates staking by taking CHZ tokens off the open market, and reducing the tradable supply.</p>

<h2 id="erc-1155-token---for-unique-tokens">ERC-1155 TOKEN - FOR UNIQUE TOKENS</h2>

<p>The final type of token in the Chiliz ecosystem, would be the ERC-1155 NFTs.</p>

<p>Basically <em>socios</em> teamed up with engine to create Ethereum based collectibles for partner clubs.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, Chiliz also announced it had integrated with Chainlink to mint NFTs in real time.</p>

<p>So why is that a big deal?</p>

<p>It allows Chiliz to create dynamic NFTs in response to real world sporting events and mint limited edition NFTs.</p>

<p>For example, if a player scores their 100th goal then limited edition NFTs might be minted to commemorate it.</p>

<p>There are also the likes of Paris Saint-Germain tweeting about <em>socios</em> NFTs too, and here’s AC Milan letting their fans know, that they should get ready for AC Milan NFT collectibles.</p>

<h2 id="chiliz---rewards-tied-with-ntfs">CHILIZ - REWARDS TIED WITH NTFS</h2>

<p>When it comes to NFTs and sport, it all makes a ton of sense.</p>

<p>Think about the crazy money that sports fans are willing to pay for collectibles, like memorabilia and sports cards.</p>

<p>But what really sets Chiliz apart from others in the NFT space is that, they understand that NFTs need to have value, if prices are going to be supported long term.</p>

<p>At the moment, they are focused on rewards.</p>

<p>So an example of that would be the ownership of a specific Juventus NFT could lead to being granted exclusive access to a VIP box at the stadium.</p>

<p>What’s even more exciting is that, we can see how those types of NFTs could really appeal to no coiner sports fans too.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/17.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="worth-the-hype">WORTH THE HYPE?</h2>

<p>Fan Tokens are really hard to value, and that’s because sports fans can really be quite irrational, when it comes to their teams.</p>

<p>There are guys, that would spend over a thousand of dollrs and days traveling to away games in far-flung places.</p>

<p>This even though their team frankly has little hope of winning.</p>

<p>When you have fans behaving so emotionally, it’s honestly very difficult to gauge your value for these token types.</p>

<p>With the CHZ token, I think in the medium to long term that it’s very simple.</p>

<p>If the platform does well, so will the token.</p>

<p>But I would urge people to be careful, and think about their entry point, if they’re considering getting some CHZ.</p>

<p>Locker Tokens do seem like a good way to give yourself a chance of making a better return on the CHZ or you’d be interested in getting exposure to a certain Fan Token, if it was launched.</p>

<h2 id="chz-on-binance">CHZ ON BINANCE</h2>

<p>Finally, on the Chiliz NFT front.</p>

<p>It all depends on the perks, that can be unlocked by holding these NFTs.</p>

<p>If they unlock great exclusive rewards, or unique experiences, that fans really want, then no doubt, that they’ll command sky high prices.</p>

<p>Imagine the demand for an NFT amongst football fans, that allowed you to meet up with Lionel Messi once a year.</p>

<p>Every fan and football youtuber under the sun would want a piece of that one.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/18.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="partneships">PARTNESHIPS</h2>

<p>But what about Chiliz partnerships?</p>

<p>Well, there is a very important one.</p>

<p>Binance is both a partner and investor in Chiliz.</p>

<p>That’s why almost every Fan Token and the CHZ token is listed on Binance.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/19.PNG" />
</center>

<p>It also gave access to certain Fan Tokens, like PSG and you have on the Binance launch pool.</p>

<p>If liquidity is something that concerns you, then honestly it’s worth considering trading them on Binance every day of the week.</p>

<p>That trade volume and liquidity is typically way better, than the Chiliz exchange itself.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/20.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Probably not a surprise to anyone out there, also Binance frankly offers way more trading pairs.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/21.PNG" />

<h2 id="fans-are-good-customers">FANS ARE GOOD CUSTOMERS</h2>

<p>Honestly, I know firsthand, how passionate sports fans can be.</p>

<p>I wonder, if fan tokens could end up becoming a bit like how diamonds are.</p>

<p>More or bigger diamonds equals more love or, in terms of Fan Tokens, that would be more Fan Tokens, the bigger a supporter you really are.</p>

<p>Let’s face it, there are billions of sports fans out there in the world, and almost everyone I know seems to love the idea of being able to influence their team’s decisions and get exclusive perks.</p>

<p>Overall, Chiliz as a project is really ambitious, the concept, and how they’re seemingly paving the way for unique digital sports memorabilia with NFTs in real time.</p>

<p>Also the idea of attaching tangible team-related perks to NFTs is absolutely brilliant.</p>

<p>That way they have tangible real-world value, and this should drive future demand.</p>

<p>There are plenty of countries in the world, where gambling on sports is illegal.</p>

<p>Think of the likes of China, where people are football crazy.</p>

<p>What Fan Tokens also allow people to do, is to speculate on the success of teams.</p>

<p>Due to that, Fan Token burn mechanism, and how in theory teams should be more popular the more they win.</p>

<p>In a way, it’s kind of like an indirect way of betting on them too.</p>

<h2 id="expanding---how-crazy-would-that-be">EXPANDING - HOW CRAZY WOULD THAT BE?</h2>

<p>There are billions of sports fans around the world.</p>

<p>The majority would probably be open to using a platform like <em>socios</em>.</p>

<p>That’s a a lot of new people, who could be introduced to the world of crypto, and that’s what makes Chiliz so intriguing as a platform.</p>

<p>Also think about this potential to add more teams and sports.</p>

<p>Accoring to the rumours, Chiliz might be planning on expanding into the US with a 50 million dollar investment.</p>

<p>How crazy that could be, if they got some big F1 teams onto the platform.</p>

<p>But with all that being said, I do believe that Chiliz long-term success rests on voting power, and rewards, that fans really care about.</p>

<p>In a crazy world, where anything seems possible, is it really so far-fetched to think that even major decisions, like transfers team sheets and formations, could be decided by fans in the future.</p>

<p>That’s perhaps something almost every sports fan would be interested in.</p>
