    <h5 id="intro">INTRO</h5>

<p>If you’re a hardcore cryptocurrency hodler you’ve probably seen many price pumps and dumps come and go.</p>

<p>At some point you’ve probably looked yourself in the mirror and asked why you didn’t sell the top and buy the dip.</p>

<p>After all, the crypto market ebbs and flows, right?</p>

<p>That’s what seasoned cryptocurrency traders believe, and capitalizing on these short-term patterns is what has made many of them so successful.</p>

<p><strong>For the average crypto connoisseur, however, hodling will provide the same profits or more than if they had actively traded.</strong></p>

<p>This is because cryptocurrency trading is hard, and the technical analysis required to do it effectively takes a lot of time, a lot of practice, and a lot of patience to master.</p>

<p>Technical trading looks incredibly arbitrary.</p>

<p>Just pull up trading view, draw a few lines number go up, and boom, you’re Warren Buffett Jr.</p>

<p>Of course, whenever you try doing this, you just get bogged.</p>

<p>Surely, there is more to technical analysis, than drawing a bunch of lines, and hoping for the best.</p>

<h5 id="history-of-japanese-rice-trader">HISTORY OF JAPANESE RICE TRADER</h5>

<p>As it turns out, technical analysis actually has some solid science behind it, and has existed for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>The candlestick chart, that comes to mind, when you think of trading, is said to have been invented by a japanese rice merchant named Honma Monehisa almost 300 years ago/</p>

<p>So, if you’re a weeb, you have no excuses not to learn technical market analysis/</p>

<p>Honma wrote what is believed to be the first book on market psychology, which details many of the patterns and terminologies expert traders continue to use to this day.</p>

<p>He’s believed to be the most successful trader, who ever lived, reportedly banging over 10 billion in today’s dollars over the course of his trading career.</p>

<p>That’s not so hard to believe, considering that he was probably the only person on the planet at the time, who had an in-depth understanding of the ebb and flow of commodity markets.</p>

<p>But it wasn’t just Honma’s first mover status, that made his trading so successful.</p>

<h5 id="human-psychology-is-the-critical-factor">HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY IS THE CRITICAL FACTOR</h5>

<p>It was his understanding, that human psychology is what fundamentally moves any given market.</p>

<p>Emotions like fear and greed follow surprisingly consistent patterns, and with the right analysis, these patterns can not only be easily seen on a candlestick chart, they can also be predicted/</p>

<h5 id="other-factors-worth-keeping-in-mind">OTHER FACTORS WORTH KEEPING IN MIND</h5>

<p>It is important to keep in mind, that although technical analysis has proven itself to be a powerful trading tool, there are other factors you should keep in mind, when it comes to crafting a trading strategy for cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>This includes things like tokenomics, network activity, use case, the team behind the cryptocurrency, any notable partnerships it has, and even macro indicators, like Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow model, and Bitcoin dominance.</p>

<p>Evaluating these factors is called <strong>fundamental analysis</strong>, because it focuses on more objective measures of an asset’s potential value.</p>

<p>If you’re a hodler, these are probably the metrics you’re using to decide on which cryptocurrency to invest in, and when to sell it.</p>

<h5 id="fundamental-analysis-vs-technical-analysis">FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS VS TECHNICAL ANALYSIS</h5>

<p>In contrast to fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses almost exclusively on price action.</p>

<p>Pumps and dumps are ultimately caused by the irrational emotions of the people holding an asset, fundamentals be damned.</p>

<p>Some would argue, that technical analysis is the more accurate way to trade cryptocurrencies, given that the average cryptocurrency holder is exponentially more irrational, than suit and tie wall street investors.</p>

<p>Given all the insane price action around food themed DeFi tokens and WIFI token clones, I think there’s a case to be made there.</p>

<p>However, each cryptocurrency will require its own special blend of fundamental analysis and technical analysis in its price projections.</p>

<p>It will be up to you to figure out, how much emphasis you should be putting on one versus the other.</p>

<p>Most of this will be determined by how long you plan to hold that cryptocurrency for.</p>

<p><strong>As a rule of thumb, technical analysis is used for shorter term trading, and fundamental analysis is used for longer term trading and hodling.</strong></p>

<p>If you really want to be a crypto king or queen, you’ll need to learn how to do both.</p>

<h5 id="trading-pairs-as-an-indicatpr-of-performance">TRADING PAIRS AS AN INDICATPR OF PERFORMANCE</h5>

<p>You should also remember that although stablecoin trading pairs, like ETH-USDT are the easiest to keep track of an asset, in terms of dollar value, trading pairs with Bitcoin, such as ETH-BTC can often give you a better sense of how well a cryptocurrency is performing relative to others.</p>

<p>This is obviously pertaining to altcoins.</p>

<h3 id="candles">CANDLES</h3>

<p>Without further ado, let’s take a look at a few of the key elements used in technical analysis.</p>

<p>Almost everything in technical analysis involves the candlestick chart.</p>

<p>Most of you are probably familiar with it by now, but I bet a lot of you still can’t explain exactly what it is, or what it shows you.</p>

<p>When it comes to trading each candle you see on that graph, in a standard cryptocurrency exchange gives you a snapshot of the trading activity within a given unit of time.</p>

<p>For example, if you have the chart set for one hour, each candle will represent one hour of trading activity for that asset pair.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, a green candle mean prices went up during that period, and a red candle means that prices went down.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Almost all the candles you see, will have something called a <strong>body</strong> and a <strong>wick</strong>.</p>

<p>The body is the thicker part of the candle, and the wick are those lines you see, poking from the top or the bottom.</p>

<p>For green candles, the bottom of the body is the price, that the trading started at, during the time period, and for red candles it’s the top of the body.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>When you see a candle, as almost nobody, it means, that almost all of the trading during that time period took place within a very narrow price range.</p>

<p>This means that the price did not change during that time.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>When you see a candle that’s almost all body with no wicks, that means price either moved to the upside or to the downside during that period.</p>

<p>The bigger these candles are the more fomo or fud we feel.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Wicks on a candle denote the highest and lowest trading prices during that time frame.</p>

<p>These wicks are incredibly useful, because they can tell us when traders are taking profits or buying the dip.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>A long wick on the bottom of a candle suggests, that traders are buying the dip, meaning price could still be bullish.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>A long wick at the top of a candle suggests, that traders are itching to take profits, which could be foreshadowing a shakeout.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>However, it’s only when you factor in trading volume, that you can really start making price predictions with candlestick charts.</p>

<h3 id="trading-volume">TRADING VOLUME</h3>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Factoring in trading volume is critical for good technical analysis.</p>

<p>Each volume bar you see at the bottom of a trading window, shows you <strong>the amount of an asset, that was traded during the time frame you’ve set</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, you want to be trading on a market with lots of volume.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Low volume tends to lead to price volatility, meaning that price could suddenly spike up or down.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Pro tip: volume is the first thing you should look at, when you’re considering buying some hot altcoin.</strong></p>

<p>On a shady cryptocurrency exchange some lesser-known exchanges will even set longer default trading time periods to hide low liquidity and questionable price action.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Make sure that you still see a high amount of trading volume with shorter time frames, before throwing your money into the void.</p>

<h4 id="price-trend-due-to-volume">PRICE TREND DUE TO VOLUME</h4>

<p>Volume is used by many traders to confirm a price trend.</p>

<p>For example, imagine you see the price of your favorite altcoin steadily dropping most of the candlesticks in the last few hours or days.</p>

<p>Have been read and it’s not getting any better.</p>

<p>Without looking at the volume, you might think this means you’re headed for some hurt.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>But when you check the volume, and you see that as price continues to drop, trading volume is also dropping.</p>

<p>This means that the downtrend you see is not very strong, despite what the price action might have.</p>

<p>You believe the bulls are standing by, and once the volume drops low enough, volatility kicks back in and the bulls are off to the races.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>The same is true, if the price is rising and trading volume is decreasing.</p>

<p>This means that there’s only a matter of time, before volatility strikes, and that could bring a strong reversal in price action.</p>

<h2 id="common-patterns-found-in-trading">COMMON PATTERNS FOUND IN TRADING</h2>

<p>Now, that you have a solid grasp of candlesticks and trading volume, let’s take a closer look at some of the common patterns found in trading.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever seen an expert trader in action, you know they love to draw lines as much as the fed loves to print money.</p>

<p>When traders draw lines, they’re normally looking for three things.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Support</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Resistance</strong></li>
  <li><strong>and a Recognizable Price Pattern</strong></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="support">SUPPORT</h5>

<p>Support refers to the lower limit of where the price of an asset could go.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h5 id="resistance">RESISTANCE</h5>

<p>Resistance refers to the upper limit of where the price of an asset could go.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>There are many ways to assess, where the support and resistant prices could be.</p>

<p>The simplest method is to look at the lowest and highest prices hit during a given time period.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>If you draw a resistance line across the tops, and a support line across the bottoms, it will give you a sense, of how much volatility the market could experience.</p>

<p>Going forward, which direction the price is likely moving, and even when to sell and when to buy.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>More often than not drawing these support and resistance lines reveals a recognizable price pattern.</p>

<p>There are dozens of price patterns, and most of these have stood the test of time continuing to repeat themselves in every market.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Ever since Honma Munihisa first defined, them almost 300 years ago, of all these patterns <strong>triangle patterns</strong> are considered to be the most reliable by professional traders.</p>

<p><strong>Triangle is created every time support and resistant lines converge.</strong></p>

<p>The two most common triangle patterns are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ascending triangles, and</strong></li>
  <li><strong>descending triangles</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>In an <strong>ascending triangle</strong>, the resistance line is more or less flat, and the support line is angled upwards.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>In a <strong>descending triangle</strong> the resistance line is angled downwards and the support line is flat.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Why the hell are these triangles so important?</p>

<p>Well, when the current price reaches the edge of an ascending triangle, price tends to spike upwards, and when it reaches the edge of a descending triangle, the price tends to drop.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Oddly enough, you can often use the left side of the triangle to determine, just how much the price will change to the upside or to the downside.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h2 id="techncial-indicators">TECHNCIAL INDICATORS</h2>

<p>If this feels a bit too arbitrary, you can use a number of technical indicators to help you double check, if you’re on the right track.</p>

<p>With your support and resistance lines, there are literally hundreds of different indicators, that people use in technical analysis trading.</p>

<p>Some of these are free to use, and others you will have to pay for.</p>

<p>Unless you’re planning on being the next wolf of wall street, free technical indicators will be more than enough to build a robust trading strategy.</p>

<p>There are 4 technical indicators, that you should know if you want to effectively trade cryptocurrency:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moving Averages,</li>
  <li>the MACD,</li>
  <li>the RSI, and</li>
  <li>Bollinger Bands.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h4 id="emas">EMAs</h4>

<p>Moving Average indicators draw the average price of an asset over a given period of time.</p>

<p>Exponential Moving Averages, or EMAs are commonly used in technical analysis trading.</p>

<p>Without getting into the details, EMAs put more weight on more recent prices when projecting a trend, and react faster to price changes.</p>

<p>Many traders believe EMAs to be the most useful Moving Average indicators.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>For this reason, EMAs, especially the 200-day EMA, are considered to be very important price zones for many traders.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>If the current price of a cryptocurrency is below its 200-day EMA, then it might see some resistance, when it hits the 200-day EMA line.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>In contrast, if the price of a cryptocurrency is above its 200-day EMA, the 200-day EMA line is often considered to be a strong zone of price support.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>The reasoning here is that, the market has basically agreed that the fair price for that cryptocurrency is somewhere within that range, as evidenced by the aggregated price action.</p>

<p>When a short-term Moving Average, such as the 20-day EMA crosses the 200-day Moving Average from above, this is called a <strong>death cross</strong> and signals to traders, that we’re headed for a downturn in that market.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Bitcoin experienced a death cross just over a week before the flash crash in March, where it dropped by 60% in price.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>When a shorter term Moving Average, such as the 20-day EMA crosses the 200-day Moving Average from below, this is called a <strong>golden cross</strong> and signals that there are many green days ahead for that market.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Bitcoin experienced the golden cross in May.</p>

<p>Its price jumped from 8000 to 10000 shortly afterwards, and has been in an uptrend ever since.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h3 id="macd">MACD</h3>

<p>There is another powerful technical indicator, based on Moving Averages called the MACD.</p>

<p><strong>MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence.</strong></p>

<p>It’s used to determine new trends in price and measure price volatility.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>For the purposes of this video, all I’ll say about the MACD is that, <strong>when the two lines you see are far apart it means, that price volatility is low.</strong></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>The closer those lines are together, the higher the volatility.</p>

<p>If those two lines cross this indicates, that the price is going to change direction, in the coming hours or days, and the direction of the bars, you see, will tell you which way the price is likely to go.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h3 id="rsi">RSI</h3>

<p>Now, for my personal favorite, the RSI short for Relative Strength Index.</p>

<p>The RSI is a favorite among cryptocurrency traders.</p>

<p><strong>This is because it tells you if a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued.</strong></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>The RSI indicator is drawn within a number range of naught to 100.</p>

<p>You can see this on the right hand side of the RSI’s indicator window.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><strong>If the current position of the indicator is below 30, this means that the cryptocurrency you’re looking at is probably undervalued.</strong></p>

<p>In other words, it’s time to <strong>buy</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><strong>However, if the indicator is positioned over 70, the crypto you’re looking at is entering bubble territory.</strong></p>

<p>It’s time to <strong>sell</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>The trend of the RSI line will give you a sense of whether the cryptocurrency, you’re looking at, is becoming overvalued or undervalued as time goes on.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>As long, as you’re within the 30 to 70 range, the price is right.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h3 id="bollinger-band-indicator">BOLLINGER BAND INDICATOR</h3>

<p>Finally, we have the Bollinger Band indicator.</p>

<p>Like the MACD, the Bollinger Band indicator is used to measure market volatility.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>In contrast to the MACD, the wider the lines are on the bollinger band indicator, the more volatility there is.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Traders, who use the Bollinger Band will generally buy, when there is low volatility, and sell, when there is high volatility, assuming price has gone to the upside during that volatile period.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>If you slap the Bollinger Band indicator on your favorite crypto, and see that its price is outside of the indicators range, its high time to buy or sell, depending on whether the price is pushing beneath or piercing through the top of the indicator’s range.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h4 id="technical-indicators---conclusion">TECHNICAL INDICATORS - CONCLUSION</h4>

<p>Using the various EMAs, the MACD, the RSI, and the Bollinger Band in tandem, should give you all the information you need, to execute effective short-term trades on your favorite cryptos.</p>

<p>Just remember that what you see, can, and probably will, change the second you adjust the time frame, so are you ready to go out and sell those tops and buy those dips?</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h3 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>As I said, it’s going to take lots of time, lots of practice, and lots of patience to build a solid trading strategy.</p>

<p>I think I covered most of what you need to, at least start dabbling in technical analysis.</p>

<p><strong>Candlestick charts show you much more than basic price action.</strong></p>

<p>They can show things like, whether people are buying the dip or taking profits.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing trend lines on candlestick charts reveals patterns that have repeated themselves in the markets for hundreds of years.</strong></p>

<p>These will help give you a sense of where the price might be heading.</p>

<p><strong>Taking note of the trading volume will confirm whether that price action is genuine or not.</strong></p>

<p>Moving Averages, the MACD, the RSI, and the Bollinger Band will help <strong>add some perspective to your initial calculations, by giving a more accurate picture of price volatility, identify any possible bubbles, or buying opportunities, and warn you of any incoming crashes or moonshots.</strong></p>

<p>Be sure, to double check the time frames you’re working with, and remember, that you’ll probably have to use slightly different trading strategies for different cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>It’s also important to remember, that technical indicators are not the be-all and end-all of cryptocurrency trading, and keeping the fundamentals in mind will go a long way, to helping make sure you see more green, than red over the long term.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more to cryptocurrency trading that I didn’t cover.</p>

<p>Sentiment analysis, whale movements, fibonacci retracements, there is still so much left to cover.</p>

        Ripple - XRP and ICU
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2021-07-30T16:10:35+01:00" class="post-date">30 Jul 2021</time>

    <h5 id="leading-questions">LEADING QUESTIONS</h5>
<p>What is Ripple?</p>

<p>How does it work?</p>

<p>Is XRP, Ripple’s cryptocurrency, a good investment?</p>

<p>And what does this all have to do  with the banking system?</p>

<h5 id="international-transactions">INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS</h5>
<p>Today’s topic is Ripple and XRP, one of the leading cryptocurrencies around.</p>

<p>Have you ever had occasion where you  needed to wire money to someone only to be told it might take several days for that money to appear  in their account?</p>

<p>That’s because most major banks are still using systems that were built  40 years ago for this task.</p>

<p>Swift, MoneyGram and Western Union  are just some examples of slow, expensive  and relatively limited systems that financial services use  to transfer money.</p>

<h5 id="transaction-going-through-intermediary-banks">TRANSACTION GOING THROUGH INTERMEDIARY BANKS</h5>
<p>On top of that, not all of the banks are connected  via the same network.</p>

<p>So, in many cases, you don’t even have a direct line  between two banks when they need to transfer money  from one account to the other.</p>

<p>In order for bank A  to send money to bank B that it doesn’t have  any direct relationship with, more often than not it will have to go through  several intermediary banks, searching for common network connections  between each other in order to clear a path for the money.</p>

<p>That’s why international wire transfers  are so slow and costly;</p>

<h5 id="money-conversations">MONEY CONVERSATIONS</h5>
<p>Each bank along the way  takes time to process the transaction and a fee for servicing the process.</p>

<p>In some cases, bank transfers must involve  currency conversions, which make things  even more problematic and expensive.</p>

<p>For example, directly transferring currency  from Japan to Nicaragua, means turning Yens into Cordobas, which is generally not feasible.</p>

<p>The reason is that Japanese banks don’t usually hold accounts  denominated in Cordobas because there’s not  a lot of demand for them.</p>

<p>However, both Japanese  and Nicaraguan banks hold accounts in dollars.</p>

<p>So instead, an individual or bank  will usually trade Yens for Dollars and then Dollars to Cordobas.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, this process can be costly  due to the multiple conversions.</p>

<h5 id="ripple-for-banks-to-transfer-ash-around-the-world">RIPPLE FOR BANKS TO TRANSFER ASH AROUND THE WORLD</h5>
<p>In short, the banking system today doesn’t have a main connecting network  with a uniform set of rules.</p>

<p>Each time you want to exchange  or send money through the banking system, you need to find a path  to transfer that money, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what Ripple  is here to change.</p>

<p>Just like the Internet has its own rules,  or protocol, to transfer information known as http. RippleNet uses a protocol,  known as RTXP, for moving value around the world.</p>

<h5 id="ripple-nets">RIPPLE NETS</h5>
<p>Ripple Labs, the creators of RippleNet, aim to create the “Internet of Value” - a way for money to move  as quickly as information does.</p>

<p>Through the use of RippleNet, there is no reason to pay a fortune  and wait days when transferring money globally.</p>

<p>The idea for Ripple  was actually first conceived way back in 2004 by Ryan Fugger and was called RipplePay, but in 2012 was passed to  Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen who founded OpenCoin  later to be called Ripple Labs.</p>

<p>Unlike most cryptocurrencies  who focus on the individual, Ripple Labs aims to serve banks  and payment providers, allowing them to lower transaction costs  and expedite settlements.</p>

<h5 id="how-does-it-work-validators-gateways">HOW DOES IT WORK? VALIDATORS, GATEWAYS</h5>
<p>But how does it all work?</p>

<p>RippleNet is a network based on  a set of rules known as the Ripple Transaction Protocol  or RTXP for short.</p>

<p>The network consists of computers,  known as validators, that are spread around the world and maintain a shared ledger of  who owns what.</p>

<p>Validators make sure every transaction  sent through the network follows the RTXP rules.</p>

<p>Anyone can run a validator  and help maintain the Ripple network just like anyone can run a Bitcoin node  to maintain the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Companies who want to access  the Ripple network can use gateways.</p>

<p>Gateways,  which are usually run by banks, act as entry points to Ripple  for people outside the network.</p>

<p>It’s the same idea as going to a bank  or a credit company to gain access to the banking system.</p>

<p>So Ripple basically offers businesses  an alternative to the banking system in the form of an Internet of value  called RippleNet.</p>

<h5 id="our-money-can-be-on-xrp-and-we-might-not-know">OUR MONEY CAN BE ON XRP AND WE MIGHT NOT KNOW</h5>
<p>Ripple products like xRapid,  xVia and xCurrent are offered to companies  in order to optimize their current solutions for transfering money  around the world.</p>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that for you, as a customer of a financial service  using Ripple, this solution is transparent.</p>

<p>If the bank switches to this technology, your bank account balance  could be residing on the XRP ledger tomorrow and you would never know it.</p>

<h5 id="two-types-of-currency">TWO TYPES OF CURRENCY</h5>
<p>This all sounds great, but what type of currency  can actually be sent through the Ripple Network?</p>

<p>Well, unlike other cryptocurrency protocols  which support only their own asset, Ripple offers  two different types of “currencies”: IOUs and XRP.</p>

<h5 id="iou">IOU</h5>
<p>IOUs are tokens on the Ripple network  that can be stored on any Ripple wallet.</p>

<p>Just like we can store  a variety of Ethereum tokens on an Ethereum wallet, we can have plenty of tokens  coexisting on the same Ripple wallet.</p>

<p>But we really should  stop the comparison here, since this is as far as the similarities go.</p>

<p>Any participant on the Ripple network  can issue an IOU, however an IOU doesn’t represent  something you OWN.</p>

<p>It represents something you OWE.</p>

<p>It’s a debt, an obligation to pay back  something you got in real life.</p>

<p>When I issue an IOU to someone, it means I owe them something.</p>

<p>When I hold an IOU  issued by someone else, it means someone owes me something.</p>

<p>Each IOU has a name  that is comprised out of who issued it and what it represents.</p>

<p>For example, USD.Bitstamp is an IOU  issued by Bitstamp promising to pay back USD dollars.</p>

<p>An IOU can be issued for  any type of real world asset.</p>

<p>For example you can have an IOU for dollars, EUROs,  gold, oil, airline miles and even cows.</p>

<p>For each asset we borrow,  we will issue a new IOU.</p>

<p>Unlike other forms of debt  that can be traded, IOUs for the same asset type  are not interchangeable if they were issued by two different people.</p>

<p>For example, if I borrow money from you  and issue you a 20 USD.Nate IOU, that IOU can’t be added to  a 20 USD.Bitstamp IOU.</p>

<h5 id="depends-on-trust">DEPENDS ON TRUST</h5>

<p>Since each IOU has a different credit line  or trust line you can only redeem  the USD.Nate IOU from me.</p>

<p><strong>It’s important to note that  the IOU itself is not the asset, it’s just a promise by the issuer  to give you the asset back in the future.</strong></p>

<p>This promise won’t do you any good  if the issuer isn’t good for his word.</p>

<p>That’s why trust plays  an important issue with IOUs.</p>

<p>In order for you to accept  an IOU from someone you have to trust that  they will be able to pay you back.</p>

<p>In RippleNet this is known as a trust line.</p>

<p>A trust line is somewhat similar to  a line of credit with the bank.</p>

<p>It’s an agreement to trust someone  up to a limited amount of money.</p>

<h5 id="xrp">XRP</h5>
<p>Aside from IOUs there is another currency  the Ripple protocol supports - XRP.</p>

<p>XRP is a currency issued by Ripple Labs to help transfer payments  through the Ripple Network.</p>

<p>For example, if a bank wants to move  large amounts of money, instead of needing to use  multiple intermediary banks to transfer the money, it can just convert the money to XRP  and send that XRP to the recipient bank.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that two banks don’t have to use XRP  to transfer assets between them.</p>

<p>Instead, they can choose to keep  an ‘open tab’ using IOUs only, without ever closing it.</p>

<h5 id="tradable-asset-and-no-trust-needed">TRADABLE ASSET AND NO TRUST NEEDED</h5>
<p>Still, XRP is a form of payment  that unlike an IOU is final and is considered a tradable asset  by anyone on the network.</p>

<p>Unlike IOUs,  XRP is the actual asset so there is no counterparty risk.</p>

<p>In other words,  once you’ve received payment in XRP, the transaction is made and there’s no fear that the other party  will not meet its obligations for payment.</p>

<h5 id="if-xrp-is-so-cool-why-iou">IF XRP IS SO COOL, WHY IOU?</h5>
<p>So, if no trust is needed  and no trust line needs to be opened when sending XRP  to other network participants, why do we even need IOU?</p>

<p>The simple answer is that XRP,  being a cryptocurrency asset by itself, is relatively volatile  and also not respected worldwide.</p>

<p>IOUs, on the other hand, are treated and valued  as the assets each represent.</p>

<h5 id="more-pros-of-xrp">MORE PROS OF XRP</h5>
<p>XRP has additional advantages as well.</p>

<p>It’s fast and scalable.</p>

<p>Sending an XRP transaction  through the network takes 4 seconds as opposed to Bitcoin’s  10 minute average.</p>

<p>Also, XRP can handle  1,500 transactions per second while Bitcoin can handle only 7.</p>

<p>So the upside of using XRP  as a form of payment is pretty obvious.</p>

<h5 id="can-xrp-be-mined">CAN XRP BE MINED?</h5>
<p>One question people ask us a lot is “if XRP is a cryptocurrency,  can it be mined?”</p>

<p>The answer is - no, it can’t.</p>

<p>Mining in Bitcoin is done  in order to confirm and determine the order of transactions  on the blockchain.</p>

<p>In Ripple transactions are handled  through a different process.</p>

<p>Let me explain:</p>

<h5 id="validators-rules-the-blockchain">VALIDATORS RULES THE BLOCKCHAIN</h5>
<p>When an XRP transaction is broadcast  through the network, the validators that maintain the network  decide if it’s valid or not through voting.</p>

<p>When a validator receives the transaction, it consults with other trusted validators and they vote on whether  the transaction is valid.</p>

<p>If 80% or more vote it “valid” - the transaction is updated  in the Ripple ledger.</p>

<p>This list of trusted validators  that a validator consults with is known as a Unique Node List  or UNL for short.</p>

<p>Each validator has its own UNL.</p>

<p>Deciding who will be included  in the validaor’s UNL is completely up to the person  who runs the validator.</p>

<p>However, Ripple offers  a default list of trusted validators.</p>

<p>Validators don’t get compensated  for their work like Bitcoin miners do with new coins.</p>

<h5 id="xrp-is-pre-mined">XRP IS PRE-MINED</h5>
<p>When Ripple Labs started out they actually issued, or “pre-mined”,  a total of 100 billion XRP and according to the Ripple protocol, no more XRP can ever be created.</p>

<p>You might be wondering, who owns all of these pre-mined coins?</p>

<p>20 Billion XRP  were given to Ripple founders - Jed Macaleb, Chris Larsen  and Arthur Britto.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs holds around 7 billion XRP.</p>

<p>40 billion XRP have been sold  to companies and individuals.</p>

<p>The remaining supply  is sealed in a smart contract that releases 1 billion XRP  into Ripple Labs’ hands each month until all of the 100 billion XRP cap  will be reached.</p>

<h5 id="some-extra-info">SOME EXTRA INFO</h5>
<p>XRP can be divided into 6 decimal points with the smallest unit  being known as a drop.</p>

<p>If you want to hold XRP you will need a wallet  that supports the currency and a minimum deposit of 20 XRP  in your account.</p>

<p>This is done in order to prevent people  from spamming the Ripple Network by opening a large number of accounts.</p>

<h5 id="deflactional">DEFLACTIONAL</h5>
<p>One last thing to know about XRP is that  the XRP supply decreases over time making it, in theory,  more valuable as time passes.</p>

<p>This is done through destroying  the transaction fees attached to each XRP transaction.</p>

<p>For example, at the time of shooting this video we’re down to about 99.99% of  the original 100 Billion XRP.</p>

<p>The “missing” XRP are transaction fees  that have been destroyed and can never be used again.</p>

<h5 id="is-it-a-good-investition">IS IT A GOOD INVESTITION?</h5>
<p>So, is it a good idea to invest in XRP?</p>

<p>When people invest in XRP they are basically betting that in the future banks and institutions  will use XRP to move value and will therefore buy XRP  and drive up its price.</p>

<p>Of course,  banks could always use IOUs instead and that will keep XRP’s price  rather stagnant.</p>

<p>Therefore, the question of  “will XRP rise in value?”, is mainly a question of whether  a majority of banks and payment providers choose to utilize it instead of their current infrastructure.</p>

<h5 id="is-it-decentralized-then">IS IT DECENTRALIZED THEN?</h5>
<p>Before we end this video I want to touch upon one more subject and that’s the criticism about Ripple  being a centralized platform.</p>

<p>There are many arguments for both sides, and while I clearly have my opinion</p>

<p>I will try to display  some of the main points of debate.</p>

<h3 id="key-points">KEY POINTS</h3>

<h5 id="no-cnotrol-over-the-protocol">(+)NO CNOTROL OVER THE PROTOCOL</h5>
<p>Just like Bitcoin, once Ripple’s protocol is published, Ripple Labs has no control over it.</p>

<p>Validators run the code themselves.</p>

<p>This is pretty similar to  Bitcoin’s core development team maintaining the Bitcoin protocol but having no real control  over the nodes that run it.</p>

<h5 id="--but-still-has-something-to-say">(-)… BUT STILL HAS SOMETHING TO SAY</h5>
<p>But while Ripple Labs  doesn’t control the protocol, it does have a lot of influence  since it is the organization maintaining it.</p>

<p>So, if for some good reason  it  determined  to create more coins, it might succeed.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs is sort of  a central bank for RippleNet.</p>

<h5 id="validators-above-ripple-labs">(+)VALIDATORS ABOVE RIPPLE LABS</h5>

<p>The Ripple protocol itself is open source, meaning that if Ripple Labs  ceases to exist, the validators can still run  the network themselves.</p>

<h5 id="-products-arent-open-source-though">(-)PRODUCTS AREN’T OPEN SOURCE THOUGH</h5>

<p>On the other hand, products the company offers  to banks and institutions aren’t open source  and are run solely by Ripple Labs.</p>

<h5 id="-only-few-validators">(-)ONLY FEW VALIDATORS</h5>

<p>The number of Ripple validators today  is relatively small, and is a fraction of the number of Bitcoin nodes  that maintain the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Since these relatively few validators are ultimately responsible for maintaining  the integrity of the network, this raises the question: how can we know the validators  aren’t colluding in order to defraud Ripple’s users?</p>

<h5 id="-iou-tokens-demanding-trust">(-)IOU TOKENS DEMANDING TRUST</h5>

<p>Another attribute in Ripple  that raises concern is that you ultimately have to depend on trust  in order to use the IOU tokens.</p>

<p>In contrast, Bitcoin’s entire system is designed to work  in a trustless environment.</p>

<h5 id="--ripple-monitors-and-reports-suspicious-activity-to-authorities">(-) RIPPLE MONITORS AND REPORTS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY TO AUTHORITIES</h5>

<p>Additionally, while Bitcoin is free for all  and censorship resistant, Ripple is committed to  monitoring and reporting any Anti-Money Laundering flags  across the network, as well as reporting suspicious activity  to relevant authorities.</p>

<h5 id="more-energy-efficient-since-theres-no-mining">(+)MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT SINCE THERE’S NO MINING</h5>

<p>On the upside, since there’s no such thing  as Ripple mining, the network itself  is much more energy efficient compared to Bitcoin’s  extreme energy consumption.</p>

<h5 id="final-thoughts">FINAL THOUGHTS</h5>
<p>In the end, there’s no clear answer to  whether Ripple is decentralized or not.</p>

<p>Personally I think the real  question of centralization arises when there’s one key figure  or company that has implicit power  over what the community thinks.</p>

<p><strong>And in this case, Ripple Labs undoubtedly  has the most influence on the entire Ripple community, making it much more  centralized in nature than Bitcoin.</strong></p>

<p>It’s up to you to decide  if you think Ripple is centralized or not, or whether that even matters.</p>

<p>Ripple isn’t built  on the same ideals as Bitcoin.</p>

<p>It’s a ‘for profit’ company,  serving the banking system.</p>

<p>Perhaps this centralized solution is a more efficient means  of international transaction, but is it the right one?</p>

<p>Hopefully by now you understand  what Ripple is and how it works -</p>

<p>A network designed to move value  around the world, mainly aimed at banks  and payment providers.</p>

    <h2 id="tokenomics">TOKENOMICS</h2>
<p><strong>Tokenomics - Token economics.</strong> Include a whole series of metrics relating to cryptocurrency, coin or token such as supply, allocation, distribution, emission and utility.</p>

<p>Coins are used to pay fees on their native network, are used to transfer value and are given as a reward to miners when a new block is mined.</p>

<p>Instead of being used for baseline newtwork activities like fee payments tokens often have unique use cases thatare specific to the projects that made them</p>

<p><strong>EXAMPLE:</strong></p>

<p>Decentraland’s MANA token which is burned to purchase digital assets on the decentraland marketplace.</p>

<h4 id="supply">SUPPLY</h4>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Dogecoind is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap even though the dollar value of each coin is low.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Other crypto, like Yarn.finance’s WIFI token, have a small supply, and its why one WIFI is worth more than one BTC, even though it has 1/4 of the market cap of Dogecoin.</p>

<p>Therefore WIFI has more potential to grow compared to Dogecoin.</p>

<p>This is because its easier for a cryptocurrency with a market cap of 1.7 billion to double in value, than a crypto with a market cap of 8.6 billion.</p>

<p>Each crypto’s market cap is calculated by multyplying the number of coins or tokens in circulation with the currenct price of that coin or token.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>In circulation means wihout the tokens that hasnt been mined yet or are locked.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Fully diluted valuation</strong> - theoretical market cap of the crypto if every coin or token was in circulation.</p>

<h3 id="allocation-and-distribution">Allocation and Distribution</h3>

<p>Cryptocurerncies are creaed in two ways - by <strong>fair launch</strong> or by <strong>pre-mine</strong> a fair launch.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>fair launch - a small community of people start collectively mining a coin or token (BTC, litecoin, degecoin). No coin or token accolactions for fair launch cryptos. Allocation is relevant to any crypto that were premined.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pre-mine is when the team behind the project mint some or all of the coins or tokoens before opening up the network to the public. A portion of these pre-mined coins or tokens is usually sold prior to the launch of the network to raise the funds needed to build it.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the coins we see today were originally sold as tokens. Specifically ERC20 tokens on ethereum.</p>

<p>ICO - initial coin offering</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Distribution of ETH. The ones in boxes are smart contracts, not actual wallets.</p>

<h3 id="vesting-and-inflation">VESTING AND INFLATION</h3>

<p>Applies to pre-mined cryptocurrencies and refers to how the coins or tokens are expected to be allocated over the coming months or years.</p>

<p>It’s common for cryptocurrency projects with a pre-mine to lock up a certain portion of their tokens and gradually release them over time. This increases the confidence of regular token holders, that the market won’t be flooded by tokens allocated to the team and private investors.</p>

<p>Usually there vesting schedules are pretty logical and take place over many years.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Extremly careful with the graph as the one above.</strong></p>

<p>Unlocking too many tokens at once or within a short time frame can sink the price action of that token in the short term.</p>

<p>When it comes to inflation, cryptocurrency is either <strong>inflationary</strong> or <strong>deflationary</strong>.</p>

<p>If a crypto has too much inflation, it can reduce the value of the coins or tokens already in circulation over time.</p>

<p>Unless the inflation schedule is extremly aggressive, it will have little to no effect on the short-term price potential of a cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies often have some degree of inflation to incentivize validators and delegators on their networks.</p>

<p>This normally ranges anywhere between 5-15%.</p>

<p>Crypto like Polkadot adjust their inflation based on staking participation to maintime the security of the network.</p>

<p>Many DeFi tokens also use inflation to reward liquidity providers and yield farmers on their respective protocols.</p>

<p>DeFi tokens often have incredibly aggressive inflation schedules to keep their annual percentage yields.</p>

<p>If the crypto is defiationary the reduction in supply increases the value of that crypto over time.</p>

<p>While this may also not have a big influence in the short term, this deflation is part of why cryptocurrencies like BTC are so valuable.</p>

<p>Although new BTC are mined every 10 mins, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 milllion and the amount of new BTC being created per block is cut in half roughly every four years.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is deflationary because of <strong>accidential loss</strong>.</p>

<p>Everytime some mofo forgets their password, it reduces the supply of crypto in circulation.</p>

<p>This means that crypto with a maximum supply like BTC are deflationary in practice.</p>

<p>Conversely, some cryptocurrencies intentionally reduce their supply by burning coins or tokens.</p>

<p>For example, an upgrade to Ethereum that’s currently in thr works would burn part of the ETH used to pay for network fees.</p>

<p>Even though Ethereum is echnically inflationary, if enough people are using this network, the fee burns will be more than the inflation, which would turn ETH into a deflationary asset.</p>

<p>Some belive that this change could propel the price of ETH well past 20k dollars.</p>

<p>Unfortunately to the people staking their ETH on Ethereum 2.0, they probably won’t be able to realize those gains even when they come.</p>

<h3 id="staking-and-utility">STAKING AND UTILITY</h3>

<p>When you stake a cryptocurrency as a validator or a delegator, those coins or tokens are usually locked up for some period of time.</p>

<p>In the case  of Ethereum 2.0 any ETH being stake will not be unlocked until 2022.</p>

<p>At the earliest, this means, that if the price of ETH starts to skyrocket, all the ETH being staked is not going to be making it onto any exchanges.</p>

<p>This conveniently restricts the actual circulating supply of ETH which could enhance the positive price action.</p>

<p>This effect is much bigger for other proof-of-stake crypto like Polkadot, where more than 60% of DOT’s supply is being staked. 28 day unlock period.</p>

<p>Cardano have no lock up periods for staked coins. This means that all of that staked ADA could move onto exchanges at a moment’s notice and push a parabolic move back down as people take profits.</p>

<p>Besides the restrictive effects on supply staking is also a common utility for many coins and tokens.</p>

<p><strong>Utility is also referred to as a use case and includes basically anything that drives demand for a cryptocurrency coin or token.</strong></p>

<p><strong>BTC’s primary utility is as a store of value, like gold.</strong></p>

<p>The difference is that, BTC is accessible to bascally anyone with an internet connection, whereas gold requires a bit more infrastructure to get your hands on and store.</p>

<p>Given how poorly fiat currencies hold their value these days, there is a lot of demand for an easily accessible store of value like Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Hence why it is the most valuable cryptocurrency on the market.</p>

<p><strong>Ethereum’s primary utility is to pay fees to use the decentralized applications built on it and move any ERC20 tokens around.</strong></p>

<p>There are hundres of Dapps and thousands of EREC20 tokens, which means a lot of demand for ETH to pay gas fees.</p>

<p>Hence, why it is the second most valuable cryptocurrency on the market.</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Market caps of many DeFi tokens like ARVE are almost one-to-one with the total value locked on their protocols.</p>

<p>This makes it easy to spot DeFi crypto that are undervaluated or overvaluated.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>While crypto tokens may be more profitable investments, they are also riskier to hold because of the regulatory risks they face.</p>

<p>Moreover, token profits are often short-lived, as many cryptocurrency projects with tokens aren’t built to last for more than a few years.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency coins often support larger ecosystems, which include Dapps, crypto tokens that gives coins a longer shelf life and results in a more gradual increase in value as their ecosystem grow.</p>

<p>This growth in value isn’t always obvious, if you’re working off of te price alone.</p>

<p>Small circulating supplies can also threaten that value in near or distant future, if any of there idle coins or tokens start to move onto the market.</p>

<p>Usually its worth to value crypto based on their fully diluted market caps. This makes it easy to spot when a cryto is overvaluated or undervaluated regardless of its price tag.</p>

        Crypto Categories
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2021-07-25T16:10:35+01:00" class="post-date">25 Jul 2021</time>

    <h2 id="what-gives-cryptocurrencies-their-value">WHAT GIVES CRYPTOCURRENCIES THEIR VALUE?</h2>
<p>It depends on which crypto coin or token you’re talking about.
There are over 7000 cryptocurrencies and each of them has its own purpose or use case that’s meant to give it value.</p>

<p>Most cryptocurrencies fall into categories such as:
-stores of value</p>
<ul>
  <li>smart contracts</li>
  <li>oracles</li>
  <li>payments</li>
  <li>privacy</li>
  <li>exchange tokens and of course,</li>
  <li>meme coins</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing which category a crypto falls into is crucial, if you’re investing in the crypto market.</p>

<p>This is because each crypto category has its own pros and cons.</p>

<p>They also tend to pump and dump at different points during a bull market.</p>

<h3 id="1-store-of-value">1. STORE OF VALUE</h3>
<p>The first category of cryptocurrencies is <strong>store of value cryptocurrencies</strong>.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, store of value cryptocurrencies are designed to <strong>hold or even increase their purchasing power over time</strong>.
While this typically translates to a gradual increase in price over time, price and purchasing power are two very different things.</p>

<h5 id="price-and-purchasing-power">PRICE AND PURCHASING POWER</h5>
<p>Every year regular currencies lose between 2-3% of their purchasing power.</p>

<p>This is because governments around the world are constantly printing money to stimulate economic growth.</p>

<p>This means that if you bought a stock that went up 2-3% last year, the purchasing power of that stock didn’t actually change, even though its dollar value has increased.</p>

<h5 id="goverments-fucking-purchasing-power">GOVERMENTS’ FUCKING PURCHASING POWER</h5>
<p><strong>The more money the government prints, the more it loses its purchasing power</strong>, and this is a big part of why cryptocurrencies were invented in the first place.</p>

<p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a response to the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

<p>Specifically the money printing by governments that followed in its wake.</p>

<h5 id="btc-supply">BTC SUPPLY</h5>
<p>Unlike regular currencies, that have an <strong>infinite supply and lose purchasing power every year due to printing</strong>, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of just <strong>21 million BTC</strong>.</p>

<p>This 21 million BTC is created gradually over time by miners, who solve complex equations to process transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain and earn BTC as a reward.</p>

<h5 id="btc-decentralized">BTC DECENTRALIZED</h5>

<p>Because anyone can mine Bitcoin and earn BTC for processing transactions, this has created a decentralized payment network consisting of millions of computers, that are spread around the world.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is technically the most secure payment network on the planet because of these economic incentives.</p>

<p>There is no single place you could go to shut it down.</p>

<h5 id="digital-gold---cash">DIGITAL GOLD - CASH</h5>

<p><strong>Now, while Bitcoin was originally designed to be digital cash, its economics combined with its relatively slow transaction speed has made it more like digital gold than digital cash.</strong></p>

<h5 id="ltc-as-a-store-of-value">LTC AS A STORE OF VALUE?</h5>
<p>While Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that falls into the store of value category, some would argue that other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin fall under this umbrella as well.</p>

<h5 id="btc-on-market">BTC ON MARKET</h5>
<p>In the context of the crypto market, Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and almost every other cryptocurrency’s price is dependent on Bitcoin’s price.</p>

<p>If Bitcoin is crashing, everything else crashes.</p>

<p>If Bitcoin’s price is staying more or less the same or moving up gradually, then all the other cryptocurrencies pump.</p>

<p>If bitcoin pumps a lot, it leaves everything else in the dust and you can see this ebb and flow in real time by watching the Bitcoin dominance chart.</p>

<h4 id="advantages">ADVANTAGES</h4>
<p>The primary advantage of store of value cryptocurrencies is that they are usually much safer investments compared to other cryptos, and they are likely to go up in dollar value over time.</p>

<h5 id="fair-launch">FAIR LAUNCH</h5>

<p>Now, this all depends on whether the store of value crypto in question had something called a fair launch.</p>

<p>This is where a community collectively starts mining that cryptocurrency from the beginning.</p>

<p>Many cryptos that claim to be a store of value were pre-mined, meaning that the team and private investors kept the lion’s share of the supply of that crypto.</p>

<p>An easy way to check if a store of value crypto is the real deal or not, is to see how its supply is distributed using a blockchain explorer.</p>

<p>In the case of Bitcoin and Litecoin both cryptocurrencies have quite equitable distributions.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage">DISADVANTAGE</h4>
<p><strong>The primary disadvantage of store of value cryptocurrencies is that, they often have very limited functionality.</strong></p>

<p>This is why some people refer to bitcoin as a pet rock.</p>

<p><strong>Store of value cryptos don’t do much besides protecting purchasing power over time and making it possible to send that purchasing power to other people without a middleman.</strong></p>

<p>This limited functionality is why many people believe Bitcoin will eventually not be the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.</p>

<p>The crypto that will flip Bitcoin will likely come from the second category.</p>

<h2 id="2-smart-contracts">2. SMART CONTRACTS</h2>
<p>Smart contract cryptos are designed to be programmable with less emphasis on storing value.</p>

<p>Here’s why this is valuable.</p>

<h4 id="centralized-apps">CENTRALIZED APPS</h4>

<p>If you’re watching this video on your computer or your phone you’re using an application of some kind to do it, be it a browser or a mobile app.
The thing about the applications you use every day is that they’re <strong>centralized</strong>.</p>

<p>They were created by someone usually a tech giant who has total control over that browser or app.</p>

<p>These applications are also not very secure.</p>

<p>Someone could hack or modify the application in some way to steal your data, money, identity, etc.</p>

<p>Those tech giants are always watching you too.</p>

<h5 id="banks">BANKS</h5>

<p>The same goes for the financial services you use.</p>

<p>Whether you’re saving, spending, borrowing or trading, you always have to do it through a centralized platform or service like a bank or broker.</p>

<h5 id="web3">WEB3</h5>

<p>Smart contract cryptocurrencies offer a radical alternative to the digital and financial infrastructure we use today.</p>

<p>This alternative is referred to as <strong>Web3</strong> an evolution of the current Web2 internet.</p>

<p>Without getting too technical, smart contracts are basically programs that do something automatically, when a certain set of conditions is met.</p>

<p>So for example, if you drop me a comment, I’ll give you a like.</p>

<h5 id="fungible-and-non-fungible-tokens">FUNGIBLE AND NON FUNGIBLE TOKENS</h5>

<p>The coolest part about smart contracts is that, they can be used to create different types of cryptocurrency tokens, that are fungible, like a regular currency, or non-fungible, like a rare baseball card.</p>

<h5 id="difference-between-smart-con-and-regular-programs">DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SMART CON AND REGULAR PROGRAMS</h5>

<p>The difference between smart contracts and regular programs is that, smart contracts are immutable and decentralized.</p>

<p>In other words, you cannot modify the smart contract once it’s been created, and it’s impossible to shut it down, because it exists on a massive network of computers spread around the world.</p>

<h5 id="dapps">DAPPS</h5>

<p><strong>When you combine multiple smart contracts together, you get a decentralized application or Dapp.</strong></p>

<p>There are Dapps for everything, including payments, trading, lending, borrowing and even gambling.</p>

<p>No personal information is required to use Dapps.</p>

<p>All you need is an internet connection.</p>

<p>The best part about Dapps is that there’s no middleman taking a cut or stealing your data.</p>

<p>All the transactions in Dapps happen directly from person to person and your activity is essentially private.</p>

<h5 id="value">VALUE</h5>

<p>Later on in the video there are over 5000 apps with millions of users on about two dozen smart contract cryptocurrency blockchains, mainly Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain.</p>

<p>In contrast to store of value cryptocurrencies, smart contract cryptos get their value from their utility as payment for smart contract and Dapp transactions.</p>

<p>For Ethereum these fees are paid in ETH, for the Binance Smart Chain these fees are paid in BNB and so on.</p>

<h5 id="supply">SUPPLY</h5>
<p>To make sure there is always enough cryptocurrency on the market to pay for transaction fees, most smart contract cryptocurrencies do not have a maximum supply.</p>

<p>Instead they have annual inflation schedules that can go well into the double digits depending on certain network conditions.</p>

<p>This printing of coins normally isn’t a problem, if there are enough Dapp users buying up the coin to pay the fees required to use them.</p>

<h4 id="advantage">ADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>And this brings me to the primary advantage of smart contract cryptocurrencies and that’s that <strong>their value is tied to the size and adoption of the Dapp and token ecosystems built on their blockchains</strong>.</p>

<p>ETH and BNB had market caps in the hundreds of billions with only a couple of million users on Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain.</p>

<p>If the adoption of smart contract cryptocurrencies continues at the rate it has, many of their associated coins could have market caps in the trillions of dollars by the end of the decade.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage-1">DISADVANTAGE</h4>
<p>The only problem there is that, <strong>you don’t know which smart contract cryptocurrency will be the winner</strong> and that’s the primary disadvantage of smart contract cryptos.</p>

<p>There is a lot of competition in the smart contract crypto category and new projects make it to the market almost every other month.</p>

<p>Unless you have the money to invest in all of them you really must do your research before taking your picks, even then you don’t know what could happen in the future.</p>

<h2 id="3-oracle">3. ORACLE</h2>

<p><strong>Oracle cryptos make it possible to bring real-world data to smart contract cryptocurrency blockchains.</strong></p>

<p>Most of the applications you use every day require some sort of real-world data, be it date and time, weather, or the price of something you’re buying or selling.</p>

<h5 id="centralized-example">CENTRALIZED EXAMPLE</h5>

<p>Centralized applications will use centralized data fees called APIs that are provided to them by another centralized entity.</p>

<p>For example, maybe the weather network will provide the API data required for Facebook to tell you what the weather is like in your area.</p>

<h5 id="real-data-but-how">REAL DATA BUT HOW</h5>

<p>Similarly smart contract cryptocurrency blockchains need real-world data for their Dapps to have real-world use cases.</p>

<p>This data comes from Oracle cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The difference between data feeds like APIs and Oracle cryptocurrencies is the data feeds that Oracle cryptos provide are decentralized.</p>

<p>How the way this normally works is that, dozens of individuals or institutions will tell an Oracle crypto what the price of something is, and the oracle will use the average of their answers.</p>

<p>Like smart contract cryptocurrency coins, Oracle crypto tokens are required to pay for the fees associated with fetching this data.</p>

<h4 id="advantage-1">ADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary advantage of Oracle cryptos is that the demand for their tokens is likely to grow in tandem with the amount of smart contract cryptocurrency Dapps and users.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage-2">DISADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary disadvantage of Oracle cryptos is that, almost all of them have allocated enormous amounts of their pre-mined token supplies to their teams and private investors.</p>

<p>What this means is that, when their prices rise there is a huge incentive for those teams and private investors to sell, which suppresses the price from going higher than it otherwise would.</p>

<h5 id="id-rather-not">I’D RATHER NOT</h5>

<p>Moreover most smart contract cryptos use multiple Oracles for their Dapp data, and some like Cardano have opted to build their own decentralized data Oracles.</p>

<p>This further dilutes the amount of demand for any single Oracle cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Examples of these coins - BAND protocol and API 3.</p>

<h2 id="4-payment-cryptos">4. PAYMENT CRYPTOS</h2>

<p>Payment cryptos aim to replace the current payment systems we use today and sometimes use smart contract technology to do this.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-current-payment-system">EXAMPLES OF CURRENT PAYMENT SYSTEM</h5>

<p>If you’ve ever sent money overseas, you know how expensive and slow it can be.</p>

<p>If you run a business, you’ll know how much money payment processors, like Visa Mastercard and Paypal take from each transaction.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever had a payment issue, you know how many hoops you have to jump through to sort it out with your bank.</p>

<p>Heck, most of us even pay monthly fees just to have a bank account or credit card.</p>

<p>No matter the context, if it involves moving money, there is a middleman somewhere taking a cut, slowing things down, and adding complication to processes that would otherwise be simple.</p>

<h5 id="better-payment">BETTER PAYMENT</h5>

<p>Instead of using an outdated payment network that takes days to settle, payment cryptocurrencies make it possible to finalize transactions within seconds at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>Not only that, but as with other crypto currencies, any payment focus coins or tokens can be kept on your own personal wallet.</p>

<p>You don’t have to rely on a bank to store your funds, and you don’t have to worry about anyone messing with your bank account or blocking incoming or outgoing payments.</p>

<h5 id="popular-choices">POPULAR CHOICES</h5>

<p>Popular payment cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Terra and Telcoin.</p>

<p>Some of these payment cryptos feature elaborate smart contracts and Dapp ecosystems focused on payments.</p>

<h4 id="advantage-2">ADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>Now, the primary advantage of payment cryptocurrencies is that they have the highest chances of achieving mainstream adoption, and the market they’re shooting for, is the most lucrative (dochodowy) on the planet.</p>

<p>Dash is already widely used for payments in Argentina and Telcoin has seen serious traction with its low-cost remittance services in recent months.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage-3">DISADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary disadvantage of payment cryptocurrencies is that it’s extremely unlikely, that any payment crypto coin or token will be replacing the regular money we use anytime soon.</p>

<p>This is in part, because most payment cryptocurrencies don’t have a stable price, and also because governments have shown us that they will step in to prevent people from using these cryptos as payment.</p>

<h2 id="5-privacy-crypto">5. PRIVACY CRYPTO</h2>

<p>Privacy cryptos are designed to preserve your privacy when making transactions or using Dapps.</p>

<h5 id="private">PRIVATE?</h5>

<p>Now, you might be thinking “but i thought cryptocurrency transactions were private”.</p>

<p>Well, as I noted earlier, this isn’t really the case, because almost all cryptocurrency blockchains are publicly viewable, meaning you can see every transaction taking place in real time, while your identity is not connected to your cryptocurrency wallet address by default.</p>

<p>It’s not that hard to figure out which cryptocurrency wallet addresses you own.</p>

<p>This is especially true, if you used an application or exchange that required your personal information to purchase cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Your real world identity can easily be linked to the wallets you transact with.</p>

<h5 id="for-who">FOR WHO</h5>

<p>It’s possible that you’re completely okay with this, and think that all transactions should be fully transparent and verifiable by anyone.</p>

<p>However corporations and wealthy individuals beg to differ.</p>

<p>The last thing they want, is for people to see how much money they’re packing in their cryptocurrency wallets.</p>

<p>Also, I’m sure that you, as a user, would want most of your data to be kept private, when interacting with certain cryptocurrency Dapps.</p>

<h5 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h5>

<p>These are the issues that privacy cryptocurrencies seek to address and they come in all sorts of textures and flavors.</p>

<p>Some privacy cryptos like Secret Network make it possible to create privacy preserving Dapps.</p>

<p>Others like Tornado Cash make it possible to privatize your public transactions on Ethereum, by mixing up your funds and sending them to a new wallet address with no transaction history.</p>

<p>Popular privacy cryptocurrencies like Monero and ZCash focus on private payments and use privacy technology that’s so good that it can’t even be broken by the US government.</p>

<p>There’s even a privacy cryptocurrency called Haven Protocol that makes it possible to mint synthetic fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies and precious metals to create an untraceable digital offshore bank account.</p>

<h4 id="advantage-3">ADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary advantage of privacy cryptocurrencies is that most of them are extremely well designed and built to last.</p>

<p>Many of them also had a fair launch with no pre-mine or greedy private investors.</p>

<p>To use Monero’s XMR coin as an example.</p>

<p>XMR has store value characteristics similar to BTC and it can be transacted as quickly and as cheaply as most payment cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Monero also uses a special mining algorithm called Random X, which makes it impossible for specialized computers to mine XMR.</p>

<p>Because anyone can mine XMR, this increases Monero’s decentralization.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage-4">DISADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary disadvantage of privacy cryptos is that, they’re frequently targeted by regulators, because of their use in illicit activities or at least that’s the main justification they use.</p>

<p>This often results in privacy coins being delisted from cryptocurrency exchanges, which makes them hard to get and this can make it harder for their prices to go up.</p>

<p>That said, cross-chain decentralized exchanges like Thor Chain are on the cusp of making it possible to trade private cryptocurrencies, like Monero and Haven, without using a centralized exchange.</p>

<p>Moreover, many privacy cryptos are actually designed to be compliant with regulations, by making it possible to show a regulator your wallet balance and transaction history, if they ask for it.</p>

<p>This is thanks to advanced cryptography.</p>

<h2 id="6-exchange-tokens">6. EXCHANGE TOKENS</h2>

<p>Exchange tokens are owned and operated by the cryptocurrency exchanges they belong to.</p>

<p>You can think of exchange tokens as being a combination of a membership subscription and company stock.</p>

<p>Exchange tokens are like a membership subscription because they can give you a whole bunch of perks, such as trading, fee discounts, and VIP access to early coin and token sales.</p>

<h5 id="stocks-etc">STOCKS ETC</h5>

<p>Exchange tokens are like company stock, because the performance of an exchange token depends on the popularity of the exchange in question.</p>

<p>This is because almost every single exchange will do buybacks and burn some of the circulating supply of its exchange token using a portion of trading fees</p>

<p>A buyback increases the price, the burn reduces the supply and the result is a cryptocurrency token that increases in value over time.</p>

<p>Some exchanges, such as Binance, have also built smart contract cryptocurrency networks that require their exchange tokens to use this.</p>

<p>Adds another dimension of demand for those exchange tokens.</p>

<h4 id="advantage-4">ADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>Now, obviously the primary advantage of exchange tokens is that they are highly likely to go up in price.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage-5">DISADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary disadvantage of exchange tokens is that their gains do not come nearly as quickly as other cryptocurrencies nor are these gains completely guaranteed.</p>

<p>As cryptocurrency exchanges become more and more powerful, regulators are slowly starting to push back.</p>

<p>As we’ve seen all it takes is a single negative announcement about an exchange to crash its token.</p>

<h2 id="7-meme-coins">7. MEME COINS</h2>

<p>Now, most meme coins have no specific use case and exist for no other reason besides hype and a false promise of profit.</p>

<p>In the real world, if someone approached you and said that you’d become a millionaire by giving them a few hundred dollars, I reckon you’d know they’re talking nonsense, at least i hope so.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, when the exact same idea is presented in the form of a cryptocurrency, this impossibility somehow magically becomes possible.</p>

<h5 id="why-hype">WHY HYPE?</h5>

<p>As far as I can tell, this is because new and inexperienced cryptocurrency investors don’t understand the relationship between a meme coin’s market cap supply and dollar value.</p>

<h5 id="shiba-inu">SHIBA INU</h5>

<p>For example, one Shiba Inu token costs around a thousandth of a cent.</p>

<p>Without looking at the market cap you probably think “wow, if I invest just a few hundred dollars in Shiba and it goes up to a dollar, I’ll be a multi-millionaire”.</p>

<p>Well, the only problem is that Shiba Inu’s market cap is in the billions already.</p>

<p>This is because Shiba has a maximum supply of nearly 400 trillion even after the recent burn.</p>

<p>Before that it was one quadrillion.</p>

<p>Now what this means is that for Shiba to reach that one dollar price tag, people would need to invest more than four times the amount of money that exists on the planet into this coin.</p>

<h5 id="hate">HATE</h5>

<p>Now, many of the meme coins you’ve seen pop up over the last few months have similarly massive supplies, which means they won’t be reaching one dollar any time soon either.</p>

<p>Before you say “but guy, the supply is deflationary, it has special economics that will make its price go up”, take a second to think about what the endgame of these meme coins really is.</p>

<p>I hate to burst your bubble, but I highly doubt that any of these meme coins are seriously planning some sort of NFT marketplace or whatever the current story is.</p>

<p>Most meme coins exist for one purpose and that is to enrich their creators.</p>

<p>You can try your luck riding that wave, but the risk is not worth the reward in my personal opinion.</p>

<h5 id="doge">DOGE</h5>

<p>In all fairness though, Dogecoin is different.</p>

<p>As far as meme coins go, Dogecoin was created as a joke, and one of the only reasons it survived the last bear market is because it can be merge mined with Litecoin at no additional cost.</p>

<p>The danger with Dogecoin is that, there is a Dogecoin whale that holds nearly 30% of all the doge in circulation.</p>

<p>If they start to dump, it’s game over, no matter how much elon musk tweets.</p>

<h4 id="advantage-5">ADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>As far as primary advantages go, meme coins do in fact offer an easy way to make a quick buck.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage-6">DISADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary disadvantage is that, you never know when the pump will come or when it will end, and the likelihood that you’ll come out in profit when the dust settles, is slim to none.</p>

<p>This is because meme coins are the most manipulated cryptocurrencies on the market.</p>

<p>It makes Bitcoin’s price manipulation look like child’s play.</p>

        Introduction to Cryptocurrencies

    </h1>

    <time datetime="2021-07-24T16:10:35+01:00" class="post-date">24 Jul 2021</time>

    <h2 id="what-is-cryptocurrency">WHAT IS CRYPTOCURRENCY?</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are like regular currecncies except they are entirely digital. Each idividual cryptocurrency coin is fundamentally just a collection of numbers and letters.</p>

<h5 id="real-banks-and-physical-money">REAL BANKS AND PHYSICAL MONEY</h5>
<p>Almost every physical money bill on the planet has a unique serial number. This serial number corresponds to info like when the bill was printed, where it was printed and so on.</p>

<p>In theory, a record of all money bills that have ever been printed and where they are, is kept by a cental bank, which shares this info with smaller banks and the government.</p>

<p>If you have a debit card or credit card you’ll know that you have an account number on there as well.</p>

<p>You also have a password or PIN number that you use to access the money in that account.</p>

<p>Your bank branch knows your account number and your name because you had to provide your personal information to open an account. This info is also shared with the central bank and government.</p>

<h5 id="example-of-bank-control">EXAMPLE OF BANK CONTROL</h5>

<p>Now let’s say you have a 20 bill with the serial number ABC and your bank account number is 123.</p>

<p>When you deposit that bill into your bank account, your bank branch, the central bank and the government will see and confirm that the 20 bill ABC has been moved into bank account number 123.</p>

<p>This is almost exactly how cryptocurrencies work. Each individual cryptocurrency coin is like the serial number you see on a physical bill just without the physical bill.</p>

<h5 id="satoshis-in-btc-like-cents-in-usd">SATOSHIS IN BTC LIKE CENTS IN USD</h5>

<p>Just like regular bills almost every cryptocurrency can be divided into smaller pieces. 
In the case of Bitcoin each BTC can be divided into 100 million pieces called Satoshi’s, which are like cents to a dollar.</p>

<h2 id="crypto-wallets">CRYPTO WALLETS</h2>

<p>A cryptocurrency wallet address is like a bank account, except that there’s no physical card that goes along with it.
It’s just an account number, because you don’t need to provide any personal information to create a cryptocurrency wallet.</p>

<p>This means that your identity is not attached to your crypto wallet like a bank account is.</p>

<p>Most importantly any cryptocurrency held in your personal wallet is held directly by you, not custodied by a bank like regular money in a bank account.</p>

<p>This means that nobody can shut down your cryptocurrency wallet or block your transactions, because you have total control over that account at all times.</p>

<h5 id="you-can-lose-your-access">YOU CAN LOSE YOUR ACCESS</h5>

<p>Now the trade-off here is that if you lose access to your cryptocurrency wallet or forget to write down the recovery phrase you get when you make one, you’ll lose your cryptocurrency forever.</p>

<h4 id="cryptocurrency-network---blockchain-explorer">CRYPTOCURRENCY NETWORK - BLOCKCHAIN EXPLORER</h4>
<p>Instead of banks and the government keeping track of everyone’s bills and bank account balances, these records are stored across all the computers connected to a cryptocurrency network.</p>

<p>These transactions and account balances are public and can be viewed by anyone using something called a blockchain explorer.</p>

<h5 id="secure-decentralization-processing-transactions">SECURE DECENTRALIZATION, PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS</h5>
<p><strong>Because computers can earn cryptocurrency for processing transactions on a cryptocurrency network, this incentivizes more computers to join the network to process transactions and earn cryptocurrency.</strong></p>

<p>This makes cryptocurrency networks secure, because there is no single point of failure.</p>

<p>This is called decentralization and it’s the polar opposite of the centralized setups of governments and banks.</p>

<p>That means the digital currencies banks around the world are creating are not cryptocurrencies. They’re creating a seriously dystopian payment network.</p>

<h2 id="crypto-categories">CRYPTO CATEGORIES</h2>

<p>There are actually thousands of cryptocurrencies just like there are hundreds of different regular currencies US dollars, euros, chinese Yuan and so on.</p>

<p>The crazy thing is that, every cryptocurrency is different and not all of them are designed to be a currency you would actually use for everyday transactions.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking there are two types of cryptocurrencies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>coins</li>
  <li>tokens</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="coins-in-a-nutshell">COINS IN A NUTSHELL</h5>
<p>Now cryptocurrency coins belong to cryptocurrency networks that were built from the ground up and buy from the ground up.</p>

<p>I mean that someone spent a lot of time and a lot of money putting together the code required to create a safe and reliable cryptocurrency network.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency coins are the cryptocurrencies given to computers when they process transactions for a cryptocurrency network.</p>

<p>For example, BTC is a cryptocurrency coin, because the Bitcoin network was built from the ground up and BTC is given to the computers that process transactions for the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Because cryptocurrency networks are so hard to make from scratch, only a few dozen cryptocurrencies are actually coins. The rest are cryptocurrency tokens.</p>

<h5 id="tokens">TOKENS</h5>

<p>In contrast to cryptocurrency coins crypto tokens are easy to make and can often be created in a matter of minutes with little to no effort.</p>

<p>This is why there are tens of thousands of tokens.</p>

<h3 id="ntfs">NTFs</h3>
<p>The NFTs you keep hearing about are actually cryptocurrency tokens, that are like digital certificates of ownership for physical or digital art pieces.</p>

<p>NTFs are just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with tokens as well.</p>

<h5 id="circle---usdc">CIRCLE - USDC</h5>
<p>For example there’s a company called CIRCLE that issues a cryptocurrency token called USDC.</p>

<p>USDC is fully backed by real US dollars, which means that for every one USDC in circulation, circle has one US dollar in the bank.</p>

<p>You can create USDC by giving them your dollars and redeem your dollars with USDC.</p>

<h5 id="paxos">PAXOS</h5>
<p>Another company called PAXOS issues a cryptocurrency token called PAXG.</p>

<p>Each PAXG token is backed by one troy ounce of gold kept in a vault here in london and you can redeem PAXG tokens for real physical gold or US dollars.</p>

<p>The best part is that both CIRCLE and PAXOS are fully regulated in the united states and regularly audited to make sure they have the appropriate number of reserves on hand backing their tokens.</p>

<p>How’s that for security.</p>

<h2 id="security">SECURITY</h2>

<p>Whether a cryptocurrency is safe or not ultimately depends on the context.</p>

<p>Not all cryptocurrencies are created equal.</p>

<p>Some cryptocurrencies are built to prioritize speed over security and usually the consequences of that play out quite quickly.</p>

<h5 id="hackers">HACKERS</h5>
<p>Luckily for us there are always hackers somewhere looking to crack cryptocurrency networks, so they can trick them into creating new coins or tokens out of thin air to sell for a fancy profit.</p>

<p>Now this might sound scary but it’s no different to what happens to banks and corporations on a daily basis</p>

<p>When hackers succeed the affected company usually beefs up its cyber security.</p>

<p>The same goes for cryptocurrencies. This means that most cryptos that have been around for years, are robustly battle tested as a consequence of always being under attack by bad actors.</p>

<h5 id="computers-spread-around-the-world-that-check-histories-and-balances">COMPUTERS SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD THAT CHECK HISTORIES AND BALANCES</h5>
<p>If you’re not convinced, well, consider this.</p>

<p>As i mentioned earlier, some cryptocurrency networks are made up of computers spread out around the world, that are constantly double checking transaction histories and account balances.</p>

<p>If you wanted to corrupt a cryptocurrency network, you would have to hack more than half of all the computers connected to the network at the same time in order to do it.</p>

<h5 id="depends-on-the-currency-though">DEPENDS ON THE CURRENCY THOUGH</h5>

<p>This is impossible to do if you have a cryptocurrency network like Bitcoin, that has millions of computers spread around the world.</p>

<p>That said some cryptocurrency networks have fewer computers processing transactions and are therefore more vulnerable to attack.</p>

<h5 id="cryptocurrency-exchanges">CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGES</h5>
<p>The same rule applies to centralized cryptocurrency services like cryptocurrency exchanges, which is where most crypto hacks have happened.
These are much easier and more lucrative to exploit than an individual cryptocurrency wallet, which is insanely secure.</p>

<p>That’s why you should always keep your crypto on your own personal wallet wherever possible and only keep it on an exchange when you’re trading or cashing out.</p>

<h5 id="criminal-activities--monero">CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES &amp; MONERO</h5>
<p>When it comes to criminal activities, it is true that ransom demands made by hackers often involve some kind of cryptocurrency, while the cryptocurrency these hackers demand is often Bitcoin.</p>

<p>They almost always exchange that Bitcoin for a privacy oriented cryptocurrency, like Monero, as soon as they can.</p>

<p>This is because Bitcoin and most other cryptos have publicly viewable transactions and wallet balances. 
This makes Bitcoin transactions very easy to trace by authorities, even more than regular currencies. 
So it makes no sense for criminals to actively use and hold a currency that’s so easily tracked.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies like Monero are completely private and even the US government can’t crack its encryption, which is seriously impressive.</p>

<p>If you think about it in sum, then the overwhelming majority of cryptocurrencies are not used for criminal purposes.</p>

<p>There are just a handful of cryptos that are actively used by criminals.</p>

<h5 id="the-real-risk">THE REAL RISK</h5>
<p>The real risk when it comes to crypto relates to investing.
Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, meaning their prices can go up or down by up to 50% in a day.</p>

<h5 id="attention-leverage-trading">ATTENTION, LEVERAGE TRADING</h5>
<p>Investing too much in crypto can be extremely dangerous, especially when you push your luck with something called leverage trading which basically uses borrowed money.</p>

<p>That’s why you should only invest what you’re willing to lose and not a penny more.</p>

<h2 id="volatility">VOLATILITY</h2>
<p>Why are cryptocurrencies so volatile? What gives them any value to begin with?</p>

<h5 id="some-time-ago-it-was-backed-by-gold-but-it-changed">SOME TIME AGO IT WAS BACKED BY GOLD, BUT IT CHANGED</h5>
<p>What gives the money in your wallet or in your bank any value?</p>

<p>Now once upon a time, it was backed by gold, but that changed, and since then all state issued currencies around the world have been losing value.</p>

<h5 id="not-its-only-trust">NOT IT’S ONLY TRUST</h5>

<p>This is because the only thing that backs dollars and euros is ultimately the trust we have in the governments that issue those currencies, and that trust has been eroding for decades.</p>

<p>Not only that, but governments have been actively printing and manipulating their currencies to benefit themselves and the corporations that fund them at the expense of the average person.</p>

<p>This has caused record levels of inflation that incentivizes spending over saving, which leads to over consumption, and causes the sort of environmental catastrophes they claim to want to stop.</p>

<h4 id="back-to-crypto-tho">BACK TO CRYPTO THO</h4>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are valuable because of what they do.
Obviously this value changes depending on which cryptocurrency we’re talking about.</p>

<h3 id="btc-value">BTC VALUE</h3>
<p>Bitcoin has value, because its BTC coin has an economic profile similar to gold.</p>

<p>It has a <strong>maximum supply</strong> and <strong>only a small amount of BTC is created each day</strong> and that amount is cut in half every 4 years.</p>

<p>Assuming demand for Bitcoin stays the same over time, this would lead to a doubling of Bitcoin’s price every 4 years.</p>

<p>However demand for Bitcoin has increased over time, as we realize how weak regular currencies can be, and this awareness has been enhanced by the current pandemic .</p>

<p>As basic economics dictate, when something has a limited supply, but the demand for it continues to increase prices inevitably rise.</p>

<p>Many investors also see Bitcoin as a safe place to park your capital outside of the current financial system, including me .</p>

<p>One important thing to note, is that most other cryptocurrencies are highly correlated to Bitcoin, meaning their prices are reliant on what BTC does.</p>

<h3 id="eth-value">ETH VALUE</h3>
<p>Even though that’s the case, some cryptos, such as Ethereum, have insane value due to the utility they provide.</p>

<p>The ethereum network can be used to create those cryptocurrency tokens I was talking about earlier and you can even create decentralized applications and websites that can’t be censored or shut down.</p>
<h5 id="gas-fees">GAS FEES</h5>
<p>All transactions related to creating and moving tokens and interacting with these applications require Ether to pay for <strong>gas fees</strong>.</p>

<p>This means the demand for ETH rises as the Ethereum network gains adoption and Ethereum has seen some serious adoption.</p>

<p>Visa is testing payments on the Ethereum network using that USDC token I mentioned earlier and the European Central Bank even issued a bond on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

<h4 id="why-it-fluctuates-so-much---no-one-knows-what-the-tech-is-worth">WHY IT FLUCTUATES SO MUCH - NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE TECH IS WORTH</h4>
<p>Now, the reason why the value of BTC, ETH and every other cryptocurrency fluctuates so much each day, is because basically <strong>nobody knows what these technologies are actually worth</strong>.</p>

<p>The prices of stocks and gold, and even regular currencies, fluctuate every day for the same reason, but <strong>cryptocurrencies are much more volatile because what they do is revolutionary</strong>.</p>

<h5 id="everything-together-against-giants-and-politics">EVERYTHING TOGETHER AGAINST GIANTS AND POLITICS</h5>
<p>Cryptocurrency networks make it possible to lend, save and borrow without an identity credit score or bank.</p>

<p>They make it possible to do business directly with other people, without a middleman taking a cut, meaning service giants like Uber and tech giants like Facebook could become obsolete.</p>

<p>They make it possible for communities to pool their funds together and vote on how they should be spent, which could eventually cut out the needs for governments and their crooked politicians.</p>

<h5 id="makes-investors-emotional">MAKES INVESTORS EMOTIONAL</h5>

<p>Now, this potential makes the average crypto investor very emotional.</p>

<p>The slightest possibility of a clampdown on crypto results in a market crash, and the most outlandish rumor can lead to a massive market pump in the longer term.</p>

<p>However, you can see that crypto is growing and that growth is unlikely to stop anytime soon.</p>

<h1 id="what-crypto-should-i-buy">WHAT CRYPTO SHOULD I BUY?</h1>
<p>Fun fact, buying and holding cryptocurrency will give you about the same amount of profit as actively trading crypto, which I don’t recommend you do, unless you plan on making it your full-time job.</p>

<h5 id="important-metrics-to-look-at">IMPORTANT METRICS TO LOOK AT</h5>
<p>When it comes to risk tolerance, it might sound a bit funny, considering cryptocurrencies are risky investments, but there are varying degrees of risk, even within the crypto market.</p>

<p>Logically, the more risk you’re willing to take, the greater reward you stand to gain.</p>

<p>Now, the easiest way to measure risk and reward is to look at a cryptocurrency’s market cap.</p>

<p>This is an extremely important metric to check, because the dollar value of cryptocurrencies can be misleading.</p>

<h4 id="market-cap">MARKET CAP</h4>
<p><strong>A cryptocurrency’s market cap is calculated by the current value of that coin or token times its circulating supply.</strong></p>

<p>The reason why Dogecoin is ranked so high is because it has a circulating supply of 130 billion, and when you multiply that by Dogecoin’s 30 cent price, you get a 40 plus billion dollar market cap.</p>

<p>Now, you might think that Dogecoin presents you with an easy opportunity to get rich quick, but getting to just 1 dollar would require an additional 80 billion dollars of active investment, and that isn’t all that likely to happen.</p>

<p><strong>As a rule of thumb, the smaller the market cap, the more potential that cryptocurrency has to grow, regardless of its dollar value.</strong></p>

<p>That’s because it takes less money to increase its value.</p>

<h4 id="examples---yarn">EXAMPLES - YARN</h4>
<p>Now, to use an extreme example, Yearn Finance’s WIFI token is worth more than Bitcoin, but its market cap is 20 times smaller than Dogecoin’s, meaning it would take less capital to push up the price of WIFI.</p>

<h4 id="look-only-at-the-top-100-coins">LOOK ONLY AT THE TOP 100 COINS</h4>
<p>With the exception of Dogecoin and a couple of others, most of the cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap, could be considered low risk investments.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano are likely to be around for many years, and they will likely double, if not triple, in price before this bull market is over.</p>

<p>The other 90 cryptocurrencies in the top 100 could still see gains of 3 to 5x, but the further you move down the list, the riskier the investment becomes, because it also takes less capital to crash their price.</p>

<p>I would personally stay away from any crypto that isn’t among the top 200 by market cap.</p>
