        Crypto Categories

    <h2 id="what-gives-cryptocurrencies-their-value">WHAT GIVES CRYPTOCURRENCIES THEIR VALUE?</h2>
<p>It depends on which crypto coin or token you’re talking about.
There are over 7000 cryptocurrencies and each of them has its own purpose or use case that’s meant to give it value.</p>

<p>Most cryptocurrencies fall into categories such as:
-stores of value</p>
<ul>
  <li>smart contracts</li>
  <li>oracles</li>
  <li>payments</li>
  <li>privacy</li>
  <li>exchange tokens and of course,</li>
  <li>meme coins</li>
</ul>

<p>Knowing which category a crypto falls into is crucial, if you’re investing in the crypto market.</p>

<p>This is because each crypto category has its own pros and cons.</p>

<p>They also tend to pump and dump at different points during a bull market.</p>

<h3 id="1-store-of-value">1. STORE OF VALUE</h3>
<p>The first category of cryptocurrencies is <strong>store of value cryptocurrencies</strong>.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, store of value cryptocurrencies are designed to <strong>hold or even increase their purchasing power over time</strong>.
While this typically translates to a gradual increase in price over time, price and purchasing power are two very different things.</p>

<h5 id="price-and-purchasing-power">PRICE AND PURCHASING POWER</h5>
<p>Every year regular currencies lose between 2-3% of their purchasing power.</p>

<p>This is because governments around the world are constantly printing money to stimulate economic growth.</p>

<p>This means that if you bought a stock that went up 2-3% last year, the purchasing power of that stock didn’t actually change, even though its dollar value has increased.</p>

<h5 id="goverments-fucking-purchasing-power">GOVERMENTS’ FUCKING PURCHASING POWER</h5>
<p><strong>The more money the government prints, the more it loses its purchasing power</strong>, and this is a big part of why cryptocurrencies were invented in the first place.</p>

<p>Bitcoin was created in 2009 as a response to the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

<p>Specifically the money printing by governments that followed in its wake.</p>

<h5 id="btc-supply">BTC SUPPLY</h5>
<p>Unlike regular currencies, that have an <strong>infinite supply and lose purchasing power every year due to printing</strong>, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of just <strong>21 million BTC</strong>.</p>

<p>This 21 million BTC is created gradually over time by miners, who solve complex equations to process transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain and earn BTC as a reward.</p>

<h5 id="btc-decentralized">BTC DECENTRALIZED</h5>

<p>Because anyone can mine Bitcoin and earn BTC for processing transactions, this has created a decentralized payment network consisting of millions of computers, that are spread around the world.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is technically the most secure payment network on the planet because of these economic incentives.</p>

<p>There is no single place you could go to shut it down.</p>

<h5 id="digital-gold---cash">DIGITAL GOLD - CASH</h5>

<p><strong>Now, while Bitcoin was originally designed to be digital cash, its economics combined with its relatively slow transaction speed has made it more like digital gold than digital cash.</strong></p>

<h5 id="ltc-as-a-store-of-value">LTC AS A STORE OF VALUE?</h5>
<p>While Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that falls into the store of value category, some would argue that other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin fall under this umbrella as well.</p>

<h5 id="btc-on-market">BTC ON MARKET</h5>
<p>In the context of the crypto market, Bitcoin is the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, and almost every other cryptocurrency’s price is dependent on Bitcoin’s price.</p>

<p>If Bitcoin is crashing, everything else crashes.</p>

<p>If Bitcoin’s price is staying more or less the same or moving up gradually, then all the other cryptocurrencies pump.</p>

<p>If bitcoin pumps a lot, it leaves everything else in the dust and you can see this ebb and flow in real time by watching the Bitcoin dominance chart.</p>

<h4 id="advantages">ADVANTAGES</h4>
<p>The primary advantage of store of value cryptocurrencies is that they are usually much safer investments compared to other cryptos, and they are likely to go up in dollar value over time.</p>

<h5 id="fair-launch">FAIR LAUNCH</h5>

<p>Now, this all depends on whether the store of value crypto in question had something called a fair launch.</p>

<p>This is where a community collectively starts mining that cryptocurrency from the beginning.</p>

<p>Many cryptos that claim to be a store of value were pre-mined, meaning that the team and private investors kept the lion’s share of the supply of that crypto.</p>

<p>An easy way to check if a store of value crypto is the real deal or not, is to see how its supply is distributed using a blockchain explorer.</p>

<p>In the case of Bitcoin and Litecoin both cryptocurrencies have quite equitable distributions.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage">DISADVANTAGE</h4>
<p><strong>The primary disadvantage of store of value cryptocurrencies is that, they often have very limited functionality.</strong></p>

<p>This is why some people refer to bitcoin as a pet rock.</p>

<p><strong>Store of value cryptos don’t do much besides protecting purchasing power over time and making it possible to send that purchasing power to other people without a middleman.</strong></p>

<p>This limited functionality is why many people believe Bitcoin will eventually not be the largest cryptocurrency by market cap.</p>

<p>The crypto that will flip Bitcoin will likely come from the second category.</p>

<h2 id="2-smart-contracts">2. SMART CONTRACTS</h2>
<p>Smart contract cryptos are designed to be programmable with less emphasis on storing value.</p>

<p>Here’s why this is valuable.</p>

<h4 id="centralized-apps">CENTRALIZED APPS</h4>

<p>If you’re watching this video on your computer or your phone you’re using an application of some kind to do it, be it a browser or a mobile app.
The thing about the applications you use every day is that they’re <strong>centralized</strong>.</p>

<p>They were created by someone usually a tech giant who has total control over that browser or app.</p>

<p>These applications are also not very secure.</p>

<p>Someone could hack or modify the application in some way to steal your data, money, identity, etc.</p>

<p>Those tech giants are always watching you too.</p>

<h5 id="banks">BANKS</h5>

<p>The same goes for the financial services you use.</p>

<p>Whether you’re saving, spending, borrowing or trading, you always have to do it through a centralized platform or service like a bank or broker.</p>

<h5 id="web3">WEB3</h5>

<p>Smart contract cryptocurrencies offer a radical alternative to the digital and financial infrastructure we use today.</p>

<p>This alternative is referred to as <strong>Web3</strong> an evolution of the current Web2 internet.</p>

<p>Without getting too technical, smart contracts are basically programs that do something automatically, when a certain set of conditions is met.</p>

<p>So for example, if you drop me a comment, I’ll give you a like.</p>

<h5 id="fungible-and-non-fungible-tokens">FUNGIBLE AND NON FUNGIBLE TOKENS</h5>

<p>The coolest part about smart contracts is that, they can be used to create different types of cryptocurrency tokens, that are fungible, like a regular currency, or non-fungible, like a rare baseball card.</p>

<h5 id="difference-between-smart-con-and-regular-programs">DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SMART CON AND REGULAR PROGRAMS</h5>

<p>The difference between smart contracts and regular programs is that, smart contracts are immutable and decentralized.</p>

<p>In other words, you cannot modify the smart contract once it’s been created, and it’s impossible to shut it down, because it exists on a massive network of computers spread around the world.</p>

<h5 id="dapps">DAPPS</h5>

<p><strong>When you combine multiple smart contracts together, you get a decentralized application or Dapp.</strong></p>

<p>There are Dapps for everything, including payments, trading, lending, borrowing and even gambling.</p>

<p>No personal information is required to use Dapps.</p>

<p>All you need is an internet connection.</p>

<p>The best part about Dapps is that there’s no middleman taking a cut or stealing your data.</p>

<p>All the transactions in Dapps happen directly from person to person and your activity is essentially private.</p>

<h5 id="value">VALUE</h5>

<p>Later on in the video there are over 5000 apps with millions of users on about two dozen smart contract cryptocurrency blockchains, mainly Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain.</p>

<p>In contrast to store of value cryptocurrencies, smart contract cryptos get their value from their utility as payment for smart contract and Dapp transactions.</p>

<p>For Ethereum these fees are paid in ETH, for the Binance Smart Chain these fees are paid in BNB and so on.</p>

<h5 id="supply">SUPPLY</h5>
<p>To make sure there is always enough cryptocurrency on the market to pay for transaction fees, most smart contract cryptocurrencies do not have a maximum supply.</p>

<p>Instead they have annual inflation schedules that can go well into the double digits depending on certain network conditions.</p>

<p>This printing of coins normally isn’t a problem, if there are enough Dapp users buying up the coin to pay the fees required to use them.</p>

<h4 id="advantage">ADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>And this brings me to the primary advantage of smart contract cryptocurrencies and that’s that <strong>their value is tied to the size and adoption of the Dapp and token ecosystems built on their blockchains</strong>.</p>

<p>ETH and BNB had market caps in the hundreds of billions with only a couple of million users on Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain.</p>

<p>If the adoption of smart contract cryptocurrencies continues at the rate it has, many of their associated coins could have market caps in the trillions of dollars by the end of the decade.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage-1">DISADVANTAGE</h4>
<p>The only problem there is that, <strong>you don’t know which smart contract cryptocurrency will be the winner</strong> and that’s the primary disadvantage of smart contract cryptos.</p>

<p>There is a lot of competition in the smart contract crypto category and new projects make it to the market almost every other month.</p>

<p>Unless you have the money to invest in all of them you really must do your research before taking your picks, even then you don’t know what could happen in the future.</p>

<h2 id="3-oracle">3. ORACLE</h2>

<p><strong>Oracle cryptos make it possible to bring real-world data to smart contract cryptocurrency blockchains.</strong></p>

<p>Most of the applications you use every day require some sort of real-world data, be it date and time, weather, or the price of something you’re buying or selling.</p>

<h5 id="centralized-example">CENTRALIZED EXAMPLE</h5>

<p>Centralized applications will use centralized data fees called APIs that are provided to them by another centralized entity.</p>

<p>For example, maybe the weather network will provide the API data required for Facebook to tell you what the weather is like in your area.</p>

<h5 id="real-data-but-how">REAL DATA BUT HOW</h5>

<p>Similarly smart contract cryptocurrency blockchains need real-world data for their Dapps to have real-world use cases.</p>

<p>This data comes from Oracle cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The difference between data feeds like APIs and Oracle cryptocurrencies is the data feeds that Oracle cryptos provide are decentralized.</p>

<p>How the way this normally works is that, dozens of individuals or institutions will tell an Oracle crypto what the price of something is, and the oracle will use the average of their answers.</p>

<p>Like smart contract cryptocurrency coins, Oracle crypto tokens are required to pay for the fees associated with fetching this data.</p>

<h4 id="advantage-1">ADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary advantage of Oracle cryptos is that the demand for their tokens is likely to grow in tandem with the amount of smart contract cryptocurrency Dapps and users.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage-2">DISADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary disadvantage of Oracle cryptos is that, almost all of them have allocated enormous amounts of their pre-mined token supplies to their teams and private investors.</p>

<p>What this means is that, when their prices rise there is a huge incentive for those teams and private investors to sell, which suppresses the price from going higher than it otherwise would.</p>

<h5 id="id-rather-not">I’D RATHER NOT</h5>

<p>Moreover most smart contract cryptos use multiple Oracles for their Dapp data, and some like Cardano have opted to build their own decentralized data Oracles.</p>

<p>This further dilutes the amount of demand for any single Oracle cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Examples of these coins - BAND protocol and API 3.</p>

<h2 id="4-payment-cryptos">4. PAYMENT CRYPTOS</h2>

<p>Payment cryptos aim to replace the current payment systems we use today and sometimes use smart contract technology to do this.</p>

<h5 id="examples-of-current-payment-system">EXAMPLES OF CURRENT PAYMENT SYSTEM</h5>

<p>If you’ve ever sent money overseas, you know how expensive and slow it can be.</p>

<p>If you run a business, you’ll know how much money payment processors, like Visa Mastercard and Paypal take from each transaction.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever had a payment issue, you know how many hoops you have to jump through to sort it out with your bank.</p>

<p>Heck, most of us even pay monthly fees just to have a bank account or credit card.</p>

<p>No matter the context, if it involves moving money, there is a middleman somewhere taking a cut, slowing things down, and adding complication to processes that would otherwise be simple.</p>

<h5 id="better-payment">BETTER PAYMENT</h5>

<p>Instead of using an outdated payment network that takes days to settle, payment cryptocurrencies make it possible to finalize transactions within seconds at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>Not only that, but as with other crypto currencies, any payment focus coins or tokens can be kept on your own personal wallet.</p>

<p>You don’t have to rely on a bank to store your funds, and you don’t have to worry about anyone messing with your bank account or blocking incoming or outgoing payments.</p>

<h5 id="popular-choices">POPULAR CHOICES</h5>

<p>Popular payment cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin Cash, Dash, Terra and Telcoin.</p>

<p>Some of these payment cryptos feature elaborate smart contracts and Dapp ecosystems focused on payments.</p>

<h4 id="advantage-2">ADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>Now, the primary advantage of payment cryptocurrencies is that they have the highest chances of achieving mainstream adoption, and the market they’re shooting for, is the most lucrative (dochodowy) on the planet.</p>

<p>Dash is already widely used for payments in Argentina and Telcoin has seen serious traction with its low-cost remittance services in recent months.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage-3">DISADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary disadvantage of payment cryptocurrencies is that it’s extremely unlikely, that any payment crypto coin or token will be replacing the regular money we use anytime soon.</p>

<p>This is in part, because most payment cryptocurrencies don’t have a stable price, and also because governments have shown us that they will step in to prevent people from using these cryptos as payment.</p>

<h2 id="5-privacy-crypto">5. PRIVACY CRYPTO</h2>

<p>Privacy cryptos are designed to preserve your privacy when making transactions or using Dapps.</p>

<h5 id="private">PRIVATE?</h5>

<p>Now, you might be thinking “but i thought cryptocurrency transactions were private”.</p>

<p>Well, as I noted earlier, this isn’t really the case, because almost all cryptocurrency blockchains are publicly viewable, meaning you can see every transaction taking place in real time, while your identity is not connected to your cryptocurrency wallet address by default.</p>

<p>It’s not that hard to figure out which cryptocurrency wallet addresses you own.</p>

<p>This is especially true, if you used an application or exchange that required your personal information to purchase cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Your real world identity can easily be linked to the wallets you transact with.</p>

<h5 id="for-who">FOR WHO</h5>

<p>It’s possible that you’re completely okay with this, and think that all transactions should be fully transparent and verifiable by anyone.</p>

<p>However corporations and wealthy individuals beg to differ.</p>

<p>The last thing they want, is for people to see how much money they’re packing in their cryptocurrency wallets.</p>

<p>Also, I’m sure that you, as a user, would want most of your data to be kept private, when interacting with certain cryptocurrency Dapps.</p>

<h5 id="examples">EXAMPLES</h5>

<p>These are the issues that privacy cryptocurrencies seek to address and they come in all sorts of textures and flavors.</p>

<p>Some privacy cryptos like Secret Network make it possible to create privacy preserving Dapps.</p>

<p>Others like Tornado Cash make it possible to privatize your public transactions on Ethereum, by mixing up your funds and sending them to a new wallet address with no transaction history.</p>

<p>Popular privacy cryptocurrencies like Monero and ZCash focus on private payments and use privacy technology that’s so good that it can’t even be broken by the US government.</p>

<p>There’s even a privacy cryptocurrency called Haven Protocol that makes it possible to mint synthetic fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies and precious metals to create an untraceable digital offshore bank account.</p>

<h4 id="advantage-3">ADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary advantage of privacy cryptocurrencies is that most of them are extremely well designed and built to last.</p>

<p>Many of them also had a fair launch with no pre-mine or greedy private investors.</p>

<p>To use Monero’s XMR coin as an example.</p>

<p>XMR has store value characteristics similar to BTC and it can be transacted as quickly and as cheaply as most payment cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Monero also uses a special mining algorithm called Random X, which makes it impossible for specialized computers to mine XMR.</p>

<p>Because anyone can mine XMR, this increases Monero’s decentralization.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage-4">DISADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary disadvantage of privacy cryptos is that, they’re frequently targeted by regulators, because of their use in illicit activities or at least that’s the main justification they use.</p>

<p>This often results in privacy coins being delisted from cryptocurrency exchanges, which makes them hard to get and this can make it harder for their prices to go up.</p>

<p>That said, cross-chain decentralized exchanges like Thor Chain are on the cusp of making it possible to trade private cryptocurrencies, like Monero and Haven, without using a centralized exchange.</p>

<p>Moreover, many privacy cryptos are actually designed to be compliant with regulations, by making it possible to show a regulator your wallet balance and transaction history, if they ask for it.</p>

<p>This is thanks to advanced cryptography.</p>

<h2 id="6-exchange-tokens">6. EXCHANGE TOKENS</h2>

<p>Exchange tokens are owned and operated by the cryptocurrency exchanges they belong to.</p>

<p>You can think of exchange tokens as being a combination of a membership subscription and company stock.</p>

<p>Exchange tokens are like a membership subscription because they can give you a whole bunch of perks, such as trading, fee discounts, and VIP access to early coin and token sales.</p>

<h5 id="stocks-etc">STOCKS ETC</h5>

<p>Exchange tokens are like company stock, because the performance of an exchange token depends on the popularity of the exchange in question.</p>

<p>This is because almost every single exchange will do buybacks and burn some of the circulating supply of its exchange token using a portion of trading fees</p>

<p>A buyback increases the price, the burn reduces the supply and the result is a cryptocurrency token that increases in value over time.</p>

<p>Some exchanges, such as Binance, have also built smart contract cryptocurrency networks that require their exchange tokens to use this.</p>

<p>Adds another dimension of demand for those exchange tokens.</p>

<h4 id="advantage-4">ADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>Now, obviously the primary advantage of exchange tokens is that they are highly likely to go up in price.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage-5">DISADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary disadvantage of exchange tokens is that their gains do not come nearly as quickly as other cryptocurrencies nor are these gains completely guaranteed.</p>

<p>As cryptocurrency exchanges become more and more powerful, regulators are slowly starting to push back.</p>

<p>As we’ve seen all it takes is a single negative announcement about an exchange to crash its token.</p>

<h2 id="7-meme-coins">7. MEME COINS</h2>

<p>Now, most meme coins have no specific use case and exist for no other reason besides hype and a false promise of profit.</p>

<p>In the real world, if someone approached you and said that you’d become a millionaire by giving them a few hundred dollars, I reckon you’d know they’re talking nonsense, at least i hope so.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, when the exact same idea is presented in the form of a cryptocurrency, this impossibility somehow magically becomes possible.</p>

<h5 id="why-hype">WHY HYPE?</h5>

<p>As far as I can tell, this is because new and inexperienced cryptocurrency investors don’t understand the relationship between a meme coin’s market cap supply and dollar value.</p>

<h5 id="shiba-inu">SHIBA INU</h5>

<p>For example, one Shiba Inu token costs around a thousandth of a cent.</p>

<p>Without looking at the market cap you probably think “wow, if I invest just a few hundred dollars in Shiba and it goes up to a dollar, I’ll be a multi-millionaire”.</p>

<p>Well, the only problem is that Shiba Inu’s market cap is in the billions already.</p>

<p>This is because Shiba has a maximum supply of nearly 400 trillion even after the recent burn.</p>

<p>Before that it was one quadrillion.</p>

<p>Now what this means is that for Shiba to reach that one dollar price tag, people would need to invest more than four times the amount of money that exists on the planet into this coin.</p>

<h5 id="hate">HATE</h5>

<p>Now, many of the meme coins you’ve seen pop up over the last few months have similarly massive supplies, which means they won’t be reaching one dollar any time soon either.</p>

<p>Before you say “but guy, the supply is deflationary, it has special economics that will make its price go up”, take a second to think about what the endgame of these meme coins really is.</p>

<p>I hate to burst your bubble, but I highly doubt that any of these meme coins are seriously planning some sort of NFT marketplace or whatever the current story is.</p>

<p>Most meme coins exist for one purpose and that is to enrich their creators.</p>

<p>You can try your luck riding that wave, but the risk is not worth the reward in my personal opinion.</p>

<h5 id="doge">DOGE</h5>

<p>In all fairness though, Dogecoin is different.</p>

<p>As far as meme coins go, Dogecoin was created as a joke, and one of the only reasons it survived the last bear market is because it can be merge mined with Litecoin at no additional cost.</p>

<p>The danger with Dogecoin is that, there is a Dogecoin whale that holds nearly 30% of all the doge in circulation.</p>

<p>If they start to dump, it’s game over, no matter how much elon musk tweets.</p>

<h4 id="advantage-5">ADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>As far as primary advantages go, meme coins do in fact offer an easy way to make a quick buck.</p>

<h4 id="disadvantage-6">DISADVANTAGE</h4>

<p>The primary disadvantage is that, you never know when the pump will come or when it will end, and the likelihood that you’ll come out in profit when the dust settles, is slim to none.</p>

<p>This is because meme coins are the most manipulated cryptocurrencies on the market.</p>

<p>It makes Bitcoin’s price manipulation look like child’s play.</p>

        Introduction to Cryptocurrencies
      </a>
    </h1>

    <time datetime="2021-07-24T16:10:35+01:00" class="post-date">24 Jul 2021</time>

    <h2 id="what-is-cryptocurrency">WHAT IS CRYPTOCURRENCY?</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are like regular currecncies except they are entirely digital. Each idividual cryptocurrency coin is fundamentally just a collection of numbers and letters.</p>

<h5 id="real-banks-and-physical-money">REAL BANKS AND PHYSICAL MONEY</h5>
<p>Almost every physical money bill on the planet has a unique serial number. This serial number corresponds to info like when the bill was printed, where it was printed and so on.</p>

<p>In theory, a record of all money bills that have ever been printed and where they are, is kept by a cental bank, which shares this info with smaller banks and the government.</p>

<p>If you have a debit card or credit card you’ll know that you have an account number on there as well.</p>

<p>You also have a password or PIN number that you use to access the money in that account.</p>

<p>Your bank branch knows your account number and your name because you had to provide your personal information to open an account. This info is also shared with the central bank and government.</p>

<h5 id="example-of-bank-control">EXAMPLE OF BANK CONTROL</h5>

<p>Now let’s say you have a 20 bill with the serial number ABC and your bank account number is 123.</p>

<p>When you deposit that bill into your bank account, your bank branch, the central bank and the government will see and confirm that the 20 bill ABC has been moved into bank account number 123.</p>

<p>This is almost exactly how cryptocurrencies work. Each individual cryptocurrency coin is like the serial number you see on a physical bill just without the physical bill.</p>

<h5 id="satoshis-in-btc-like-cents-in-usd">SATOSHIS IN BTC LIKE CENTS IN USD</h5>

<p>Just like regular bills almost every cryptocurrency can be divided into smaller pieces. 
In the case of Bitcoin each BTC can be divided into 100 million pieces called Satoshi’s, which are like cents to a dollar.</p>

<h2 id="crypto-wallets">CRYPTO WALLETS</h2>

<p>A cryptocurrency wallet address is like a bank account, except that there’s no physical card that goes along with it.
It’s just an account number, because you don’t need to provide any personal information to create a cryptocurrency wallet.</p>

<p>This means that your identity is not attached to your crypto wallet like a bank account is.</p>

<p>Most importantly any cryptocurrency held in your personal wallet is held directly by you, not custodied by a bank like regular money in a bank account.</p>

<p>This means that nobody can shut down your cryptocurrency wallet or block your transactions, because you have total control over that account at all times.</p>

<h5 id="you-can-lose-your-access">YOU CAN LOSE YOUR ACCESS</h5>

<p>Now the trade-off here is that if you lose access to your cryptocurrency wallet or forget to write down the recovery phrase you get when you make one, you’ll lose your cryptocurrency forever.</p>

<h4 id="cryptocurrency-network---blockchain-explorer">CRYPTOCURRENCY NETWORK - BLOCKCHAIN EXPLORER</h4>
<p>Instead of banks and the government keeping track of everyone’s bills and bank account balances, these records are stored across all the computers connected to a cryptocurrency network.</p>

<p>These transactions and account balances are public and can be viewed by anyone using something called a blockchain explorer.</p>

<h5 id="secure-decentralization-processing-transactions">SECURE DECENTRALIZATION, PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS</h5>
<p><strong>Because computers can earn cryptocurrency for processing transactions on a cryptocurrency network, this incentivizes more computers to join the network to process transactions and earn cryptocurrency.</strong></p>

<p>This makes cryptocurrency networks secure, because there is no single point of failure.</p>

<p>This is called decentralization and it’s the polar opposite of the centralized setups of governments and banks.</p>

<p>That means the digital currencies banks around the world are creating are not cryptocurrencies. They’re creating a seriously dystopian payment network.</p>

<h2 id="crypto-categories">CRYPTO CATEGORIES</h2>

<p>There are actually thousands of cryptocurrencies just like there are hundreds of different regular currencies US dollars, euros, chinese Yuan and so on.</p>

<p>The crazy thing is that, every cryptocurrency is different and not all of them are designed to be a currency you would actually use for everyday transactions.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking there are two types of cryptocurrencies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>coins</li>
  <li>tokens</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="coins-in-a-nutshell">COINS IN A NUTSHELL</h5>
<p>Now cryptocurrency coins belong to cryptocurrency networks that were built from the ground up and buy from the ground up.</p>

<p>I mean that someone spent a lot of time and a lot of money putting together the code required to create a safe and reliable cryptocurrency network.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency coins are the cryptocurrencies given to computers when they process transactions for a cryptocurrency network.</p>

<p>For example, BTC is a cryptocurrency coin, because the Bitcoin network was built from the ground up and BTC is given to the computers that process transactions for the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Because cryptocurrency networks are so hard to make from scratch, only a few dozen cryptocurrencies are actually coins. The rest are cryptocurrency tokens.</p>

<h5 id="tokens">TOKENS</h5>

<p>In contrast to cryptocurrency coins crypto tokens are easy to make and can often be created in a matter of minutes with little to no effort.</p>

<p>This is why there are tens of thousands of tokens.</p>

<h3 id="ntfs">NTFs</h3>
<p>The NFTs you keep hearing about are actually cryptocurrency tokens, that are like digital certificates of ownership for physical or digital art pieces.</p>

<p>NTFs are just the tip of the iceberg of what you can do with tokens as well.</p>

<h5 id="circle---usdc">CIRCLE - USDC</h5>
<p>For example there’s a company called CIRCLE that issues a cryptocurrency token called USDC.</p>

<p>USDC is fully backed by real US dollars, which means that for every one USDC in circulation, circle has one US dollar in the bank.</p>

<p>You can create USDC by giving them your dollars and redeem your dollars with USDC.</p>

<h5 id="paxos">PAXOS</h5>
<p>Another company called PAXOS issues a cryptocurrency token called PAXG.</p>

<p>Each PAXG token is backed by one troy ounce of gold kept in a vault here in london and you can redeem PAXG tokens for real physical gold or US dollars.</p>

<p>The best part is that both CIRCLE and PAXOS are fully regulated in the united states and regularly audited to make sure they have the appropriate number of reserves on hand backing their tokens.</p>

<p>How’s that for security.</p>

<h2 id="security">SECURITY</h2>

<p>Whether a cryptocurrency is safe or not ultimately depends on the context.</p>

<p>Not all cryptocurrencies are created equal.</p>

<p>Some cryptocurrencies are built to prioritize speed over security and usually the consequences of that play out quite quickly.</p>

<h5 id="hackers">HACKERS</h5>
<p>Luckily for us there are always hackers somewhere looking to crack cryptocurrency networks, so they can trick them into creating new coins or tokens out of thin air to sell for a fancy profit.</p>

<p>Now this might sound scary but it’s no different to what happens to banks and corporations on a daily basis</p>

<p>When hackers succeed the affected company usually beefs up its cyber security.</p>

<p>The same goes for cryptocurrencies. This means that most cryptos that have been around for years, are robustly battle tested as a consequence of always being under attack by bad actors.</p>

<h5 id="computers-spread-around-the-world-that-check-histories-and-balances">COMPUTERS SPREAD AROUND THE WORLD THAT CHECK HISTORIES AND BALANCES</h5>
<p>If you’re not convinced, well, consider this.</p>

<p>As i mentioned earlier, some cryptocurrency networks are made up of computers spread out around the world, that are constantly double checking transaction histories and account balances.</p>

<p>If you wanted to corrupt a cryptocurrency network, you would have to hack more than half of all the computers connected to the network at the same time in order to do it.</p>

<h5 id="depends-on-the-currency-though">DEPENDS ON THE CURRENCY THOUGH</h5>

<p>This is impossible to do if you have a cryptocurrency network like Bitcoin, that has millions of computers spread around the world.</p>

<p>That said some cryptocurrency networks have fewer computers processing transactions and are therefore more vulnerable to attack.</p>

<h5 id="cryptocurrency-exchanges">CRYPTOCURRENCY EXCHANGES</h5>
<p>The same rule applies to centralized cryptocurrency services like cryptocurrency exchanges, which is where most crypto hacks have happened.
These are much easier and more lucrative to exploit than an individual cryptocurrency wallet, which is insanely secure.</p>

<p>That’s why you should always keep your crypto on your own personal wallet wherever possible and only keep it on an exchange when you’re trading or cashing out.</p>

<h5 id="criminal-activities--monero">CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES &amp; MONERO</h5>
<p>When it comes to criminal activities, it is true that ransom demands made by hackers often involve some kind of cryptocurrency, while the cryptocurrency these hackers demand is often Bitcoin.</p>

<p>They almost always exchange that Bitcoin for a privacy oriented cryptocurrency, like Monero, as soon as they can.</p>

<p>This is because Bitcoin and most other cryptos have publicly viewable transactions and wallet balances. 
This makes Bitcoin transactions very easy to trace by authorities, even more than regular currencies. 
So it makes no sense for criminals to actively use and hold a currency that’s so easily tracked.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies like Monero are completely private and even the US government can’t crack its encryption, which is seriously impressive.</p>

<p>If you think about it in sum, then the overwhelming majority of cryptocurrencies are not used for criminal purposes.</p>

<p>There are just a handful of cryptos that are actively used by criminals.</p>

<h5 id="the-real-risk">THE REAL RISK</h5>
<p>The real risk when it comes to crypto relates to investing.
Cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, meaning their prices can go up or down by up to 50% in a day.</p>

<h5 id="attention-leverage-trading">ATTENTION, LEVERAGE TRADING</h5>
<p>Investing too much in crypto can be extremely dangerous, especially when you push your luck with something called leverage trading which basically uses borrowed money.</p>

<p>That’s why you should only invest what you’re willing to lose and not a penny more.</p>

<h2 id="volatility">VOLATILITY</h2>
<p>Why are cryptocurrencies so volatile? What gives them any value to begin with?</p>

<h5 id="some-time-ago-it-was-backed-by-gold-but-it-changed">SOME TIME AGO IT WAS BACKED BY GOLD, BUT IT CHANGED</h5>
<p>What gives the money in your wallet or in your bank any value?</p>

<p>Now once upon a time, it was backed by gold, but that changed, and since then all state issued currencies around the world have been losing value.</p>

<h5 id="not-its-only-trust">NOT IT’S ONLY TRUST</h5>

<p>This is because the only thing that backs dollars and euros is ultimately the trust we have in the governments that issue those currencies, and that trust has been eroding for decades.</p>

<p>Not only that, but governments have been actively printing and manipulating their currencies to benefit themselves and the corporations that fund them at the expense of the average person.</p>

<p>This has caused record levels of inflation that incentivizes spending over saving, which leads to over consumption, and causes the sort of environmental catastrophes they claim to want to stop.</p>

<h4 id="back-to-crypto-tho">BACK TO CRYPTO THO</h4>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are valuable because of what they do.
Obviously this value changes depending on which cryptocurrency we’re talking about.</p>

<h3 id="btc-value">BTC VALUE</h3>
<p>Bitcoin has value, because its BTC coin has an economic profile similar to gold.</p>

<p>It has a <strong>maximum supply</strong> and <strong>only a small amount of BTC is created each day</strong> and that amount is cut in half every 4 years.</p>

<p>Assuming demand for Bitcoin stays the same over time, this would lead to a doubling of Bitcoin’s price every 4 years.</p>

<p>However demand for Bitcoin has increased over time, as we realize how weak regular currencies can be, and this awareness has been enhanced by the current pandemic .</p>

<p>As basic economics dictate, when something has a limited supply, but the demand for it continues to increase prices inevitably rise.</p>

<p>Many investors also see Bitcoin as a safe place to park your capital outside of the current financial system, including me .</p>

<p>One important thing to note, is that most other cryptocurrencies are highly correlated to Bitcoin, meaning their prices are reliant on what BTC does.</p>

<h3 id="eth-value">ETH VALUE</h3>
<p>Even though that’s the case, some cryptos, such as Ethereum, have insane value due to the utility they provide.</p>

<p>The ethereum network can be used to create those cryptocurrency tokens I was talking about earlier and you can even create decentralized applications and websites that can’t be censored or shut down.</p>
<h5 id="gas-fees">GAS FEES</h5>
<p>All transactions related to creating and moving tokens and interacting with these applications require Ether to pay for <strong>gas fees</strong>.</p>

<p>This means the demand for ETH rises as the Ethereum network gains adoption and Ethereum has seen some serious adoption.</p>

<p>Visa is testing payments on the Ethereum network using that USDC token I mentioned earlier and the European Central Bank even issued a bond on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>

<h4 id="why-it-fluctuates-so-much---no-one-knows-what-the-tech-is-worth">WHY IT FLUCTUATES SO MUCH - NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE TECH IS WORTH</h4>
<p>Now, the reason why the value of BTC, ETH and every other cryptocurrency fluctuates so much each day, is because basically <strong>nobody knows what these technologies are actually worth</strong>.</p>

<p>The prices of stocks and gold, and even regular currencies, fluctuate every day for the same reason, but <strong>cryptocurrencies are much more volatile because what they do is revolutionary</strong>.</p>

<h5 id="everything-together-against-giants-and-politics">EVERYTHING TOGETHER AGAINST GIANTS AND POLITICS</h5>
<p>Cryptocurrency networks make it possible to lend, save and borrow without an identity credit score or bank.</p>

<p>They make it possible to do business directly with other people, without a middleman taking a cut, meaning service giants like Uber and tech giants like Facebook could become obsolete.</p>

<p>They make it possible for communities to pool their funds together and vote on how they should be spent, which could eventually cut out the needs for governments and their crooked politicians.</p>

<h5 id="makes-investors-emotional">MAKES INVESTORS EMOTIONAL</h5>

<p>Now, this potential makes the average crypto investor very emotional.</p>

<p>The slightest possibility of a clampdown on crypto results in a market crash, and the most outlandish rumor can lead to a massive market pump in the longer term.</p>

<p>However, you can see that crypto is growing and that growth is unlikely to stop anytime soon.</p>

<h1 id="what-crypto-should-i-buy">WHAT CRYPTO SHOULD I BUY?</h1>
<p>Fun fact, buying and holding cryptocurrency will give you about the same amount of profit as actively trading crypto, which I don’t recommend you do, unless you plan on making it your full-time job.</p>

<h5 id="important-metrics-to-look-at">IMPORTANT METRICS TO LOOK AT</h5>
<p>When it comes to risk tolerance, it might sound a bit funny, considering cryptocurrencies are risky investments, but there are varying degrees of risk, even within the crypto market.</p>

<p>Logically, the more risk you’re willing to take, the greater reward you stand to gain.</p>

<p>Now, the easiest way to measure risk and reward is to look at a cryptocurrency’s market cap.</p>

<p>This is an extremely important metric to check, because the dollar value of cryptocurrencies can be misleading.</p>

<h4 id="market-cap">MARKET CAP</h4>
<p><strong>A cryptocurrency’s market cap is calculated by the current value of that coin or token times its circulating supply.</strong></p>

<p>The reason why Dogecoin is ranked so high is because it has a circulating supply of 130 billion, and when you multiply that by Dogecoin’s 30 cent price, you get a 40 plus billion dollar market cap.</p>

<p>Now, you might think that Dogecoin presents you with an easy opportunity to get rich quick, but getting to just 1 dollar would require an additional 80 billion dollars of active investment, and that isn’t all that likely to happen.</p>

<p><strong>As a rule of thumb, the smaller the market cap, the more potential that cryptocurrency has to grow, regardless of its dollar value.</strong></p>

<p>That’s because it takes less money to increase its value.</p>

<h4 id="examples---yarn">EXAMPLES - YARN</h4>
<p>Now, to use an extreme example, Yearn Finance’s WIFI token is worth more than Bitcoin, but its market cap is 20 times smaller than Dogecoin’s, meaning it would take less capital to push up the price of WIFI.</p>

<h4 id="look-only-at-the-top-100-coins">LOOK ONLY AT THE TOP 100 COINS</h4>
<p>With the exception of Dogecoin and a couple of others, most of the cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market cap, could be considered low risk investments.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano are likely to be around for many years, and they will likely double, if not triple, in price before this bull market is over.</p>

<p>The other 90 cryptocurrencies in the top 100 could still see gains of 3 to 5x, but the further you move down the list, the riskier the investment becomes, because it also takes less capital to crash their price.</p>

<p>I would personally stay away from any crypto that isn’t among the top 200 by market cap.</p>

    <h2 id="data-types">Data types</h2>

<p>Discrete Data:
    - integer based, often counts of some event.
    - How many purchases did a customer make in a yera?
    - How many times did I flif heads?
 Continous Data
     - Has an infinite number of possible values
     - How much time did it take for a user to check out?
     -  How much rain fell on a givern day?</p>

<p>Categorical Data:
    Qualitative data
    - Gender, Yes/ no, race, etc.</p>

<p>Ordinal:
    A miture of numerical and categorical
    - Categorical data that has mathematical meaning: 1 means worse movie than a 2</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>Mode: the most common number in a data set</p>

<h3 id="variance">Variance:</h3>
<p>Measeures how “pread-out” the data is.
Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean
EXAMPLE:
Variance of set (1, 4, 5, 4, 8)
    - First find the mean (1+4+5+4+8)/5 = 4.4
    = Now find the differences from the mean: (1 - 4.4, 4- 4.4, 5 - 4.4, etc)
    - (-3.4, -0.4, 0.6, -0.4, 3.6)
    - find the squared differences: (11.56, 0.16, 0.36, 0.16, 12.96)
    - find the average of the squared differences:
    a~2 = (11.56 + 0.16 + 0.36 + 0.16 + 12.96) / 5 = 5.04</p>

<h3 id="standard-deviation">Standard deviation:</h3>
<p>Square room of the variance</p>

<p>Is usually used as a way to identify outliers (wartości odstajace). Data points that lie more than one standard deviation from the mean can be considered unusual.</p>

<p>You can talk about how extreme a data point is by talking about “how many sigmas” away from the mean iti is.
<img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p>So, the standard variation of (1, 4, 5, 4, 8) is 2.24.</p>

<h3 id="moments">Moments</h3>

<p>Quantitative measures of the shape of a probability density function</p>

<p>Mathematically they are hard to wrap up:</p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The first moment is the mean.</li>
  <li>The second moment is the variance.</li>
  <li>Third moment is “skew”
    <ul>
      <li>How loopsided is the distribution?</li>
      <li>A distribution with a longer tail on the left will be skewed left, and have a negative skew.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>The fourth moment is “kurtosis”
    <ul>
      <li>How thick is the tail, and how sharp is the peak, compared to a normal distribution?</li>
      <li>F. e.: higher peaks have highter kurtosis</li>
    </ul>

<h3 id="covariance">Covariance</h3>

<p>Measures how two variables vary in tandem from their means.</p>
<ul>
  <li>think of the data sets for the two variables as high-dimensional vetors</li>
  <li>convert these to vectors of variances from the mean</li>
  <li>take the dot product (cosine of the angle between them) of the two vectors</li>
  <li>divide by the sample size</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="correlation">Correlation</h3>

<p>Just divide the covariance by the stanard deviations of both variables, and that normalizes things</p>
<ul>
  <li>so a correlation of -1 means a perfect inverse correlation</li>
  <li>correlation of 0: no correlation</li>
  <li>correlation 1: perfect correlation</li>

<p>Sometimg you may learn in statics is that P(E, F) = P(E)P(F)</p>

<p>But this assumes E and F are independent.</p>

<p>We’ve found that P(E, F) is about 0.5 while P(E)P(F) is about 0.75.</p>

<p>So when E and F are dependent and we hava a conditional probability going on, we can;t just say that P(E, F) = P(E)P(F)</p>

<p>The probability of A given B, is the probability of A times the probability of B given A ver the probability of B.</p>

<p>Prawdopodobieństwo A danego B jest prawdopodobieństwem A razy prawdopodobieństwo B przy danym A w stosunku do prawdopodobieństwa B.</p>

<p>The key insight is that the probability of something that depends on B depends very much on the base probability of A and B.</p>

<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>

<h3 id="1-what-are-the-different-types-of-machine-learning">1. What are the different types of Machine Learning?</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Supervised Learning
    <ul>
      <li>machine lears using labeled data</li>
      <li>it’s like learning under the guidace of a teacher</li>
      <li>model is trained on pre-defined dataset before it starts making decision when given new data</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Unsupervised Learning
    <ul>
      <li>the machine is trained on unlabelled data, without any guidance</li>
      <li>learning without a teacher</li>
      <li>models learn through observation and finds structures in data</li>
      <li>model is given a dataset and then left to automatically find patterns and relationships by creating clusters</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Reinforcement Learning
    <ul>
      <li>involves an agent that interacts with its environment by producing actions &amp; discovers errors or rewards’- it’s like being stuck in an isolated island where you must explore the environment and learn how to live and adapt to the living conditions on your own</li>
      <li>model learns through hit and trial method</li>
      <li>learns on the basis of reward or penalty given for every action it performs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="2-how-would-you-explain-machine-learning-to-a-school-going-kid">2. How would you explain Machine Learning to a school-going kid?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Suppose your friend invites you to his party where you meet total strangers.
Since you have no idea about them, you will mentally classify them on the basis of gender, age, group, dressing, etc.</li>
  <li>in this scenari the strangers represent the unlabelled data and the process od classifying unlabelled data point (unsupervised learning)</li>
  <li>since you didn’t use any prior knowledge abut people and classified them on-the-go, this becomes an unsupervised learning problem.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3--how-does-deep-learning-differ-from-machine-learning">3.  How does Deep Learning differ from Machine Learning?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>DEEP LEARNING - form of ML that is inspired by the structure of the human brain and is particulary effective in feature detection.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MACHINE LEARNING - algorithms that parse data, learn from data, and then apply what they’ve learnt to make informed decisions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-explain-classification-and-regression">4. Explain Classification and Regression</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Classification:
    <ul>
      <li>predicting a discrete class label</li>
      <li>data is labelled into one of two or more class</li>
      <li>two classes -&gt; binary, more -&gt; multi-class classification</li>
      <li>examples: classifying email as SPAM or non-SPAM</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Regression:
    <ul>
      <li>predicting a continous quantity</li>
      <li>requires the prediction of a quantity</li>
      <li>if it has multiple input variables it’s called a multivariate regression</li>
      <li>examples: predicting the price of a stock over a period of time</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="5-what-do-you-understand-by-selection-bias">5. What do you understand by selection bias?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>statistical error that causes a bias in the sampling portion of an experiment</li>
  <li>the error causes one sampling group to be selected more often than other groups included in the experiment</li>
  <li>
    <p>selection bias may produce an inaccurate conclusion if the selection bias is not identified</p>
  </li>
  <li>błąd statystyczny, który powoduje odchylenie w próbkowaniu części eksperymentu</li>
  <li>błąd powoduje, że jedna grupa losowania jest wybierana częściej niż inne grupy objęte eksperymentem</li>
  <li>błąd selekcji może prowadzić do niedokładnych wniosków, jeśli błąd selekcji nie zostanie zidentyfikowany</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="6-what-do-you-understand-by-precision-and-recall">6. What do you understand by Precision and Recall?</h3>
<p>Let me explain you this with an analogy:</p>

<p>Imagine that, your girlfriend gave you a birthday surprise every year for the last 10 years. One day, your girlfriend asks you: ‘Sweetie, do you remember all the birthday surprises from me?’
To stay on good terms with your girlfriend, you need to recall all the 10 events from your memory. Therefore, recall is the ratio of the number of events you can correctly recall, to the total number of events.</p>

<p>If you can recall all 10 events correctly, then, your recall ratio is 1.0 (100%) and if you can recall 7 events correctly, your recall ratio is 0.7 (70%).</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>However, you might be wrong in some answers.</p>

<p>For example, let’s assume that you took 15 guesses out of which 10 were correct and 5 were wrong. This means that you can recall all events but not so precisely.</p>

<p>Therefore, precision is the ratio of a number of events you can correctly recall, to the total number of events you can recall (mix of correct and wrong recalls).</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>From the above example (10 real events, 15 answers: 10 correct, 5 wrong), you get 100% recall but your precision is only 66.67% (10 / 15)</p>

<h3 id="7-explain-false-negative-false-positive-true-negative-and-true-positive-with-a-simple-example">7. Explain false negative, false positive, true negative and true positive with a simple example.</h3>
<p>Scenario of a fire emergency:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>True Positive</strong>: If the alarm goes on in case of a fire.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>FIRE IS POSITIVE AND PREDICTION MADE BY THE SYSTEM IS TRUE</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>False Positive</strong>: if the alarm goes on and there is no fire.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>SYSTEM PREDICTED FIRE TO BE POSITIVE WHICH IS A WRONG PREDICTION HENCE THE PREDICTION IS FALSE</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>False Negative</strong>: If the alarm does not ring but there was a fire.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>SYSTEM PREDICTED FIRE TO BE NEGATIVE WHICH WAS FALSE SINCE THERE WAS FIRE.</em></p>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>True Negative</strong>: If the alarm does not ring and there was no fire</li>
</ul>

<p><em>THE FIRE IS NEGATIVE AND THIS PREDICTION WAS TRUE</em></p>

<h3 id="8-what-is-a-confusion-matrix">8. What is a Confusion Matrix?</h3>

<h3 id="9-what-is-the-difference-between-inductive-and-deductive-learning">9. What is the difference between inductive and deductive learning?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Inductive learning</strong> is the process of using observations to draw conclusions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Deductive learning</strong> is the process of using conclusions to form observations</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<h3 id="10-how-is-knn-different-from-k-means-clustering">10. How is KNN different from K-means clustering?</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>K-Nearest Neighbour</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Supervised Technique</li>
      <li>Used for Classification or Regression</li>
      <li>“K” in KNN represents the number of nearest neighbours used to classify or predict in case of continous variable/regression</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>K-Means Clustering</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Unsupervised Technique</li>
      <li>Used for Clustering</li>
      <li>“K” in K Means represent the number of clusters the algorithm is trying to identify or learn from the data</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="11-what-is-roc-curve-and-what-does-it-represent">11. What is ROC curve and what does it represent?</h3>
<p><strong>Receiver Operating Characteristic</strong> curve is a fundamental tool for diagnostic test evaluation and is a plot of the true positive rate (Sensivity) against the false positive rate (Specifity) for the different possible cut-off points of a diagnostic test.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="attachment:image.png" alt="image.png" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>it shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specifity (any increase in sensitivity will be accompanied by a decrease in specifity)</li>
  <li>the closer the curve follows the left-hand border and then the top border of the ROC space</li>
</ul>
