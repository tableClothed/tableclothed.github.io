<h2 id="tokenizing-sport">TOKENIZING SPORT</h2>

<p>The team at Chiliz is all about tokenizing the sports and entertainment sectors by creating a fan engagement platform.</p>

<p>Yes, that does sound great, but why on Earth would anyone want to do that, in the first place?</p>

<p>It’s pretty sure that everyone has at least a passing interest in sports. But the deal is:</p>

<h2 id="a-mere-fan-cant-make-a-decision-on-his-team-unless">A MERE FAN CAN’T MAKE A DECISION ON HIS TEAM… UNLESS?</h2>

<p>Sports fans can only really watch their team, buy the merch, and buy overpriced match day treats.</p>

<p>In essence, we’re all passive sports content consumers, and have no active influence over what happens with the team.</p>

<p>Actually, maybe most <em>normal</em> people like are passive sports content consumers.</p>

<p>It is true, that if you’re a billionaire, like Sheikh Mansour, you might decide to buy a football team like Manchester City.</p>

<p>But for other people, there are almost no systems in place to influence their team’s decisions, which is annoying for fans, when their manager or coach makes some silly decision.</p>

<p>Chiliz basically aims to solve that problem by giving fans a say in their team’s management, as well, as a new way to engage with their team.</p>

<h2 id="why-would-players-and-teams-agree-to-this">WHY WOULD PLAYERS AND TEAMS AGREE TO THIS?</h2>

<p>It’s pretty cool, but why would a sports team want to give fans a say?</p>

<p>Surely there are a ton of highly paid bigwigs, that would be out of a job.</p>

<p>Well, the teams dictate the decisions that fans can influence, so some teams might not want to crowdsource that team sheet every day, which is understandable.</p>

<p>Most sports teams out there are businesses, and that means they need to make money.</p>

<p>Those star players don’t tend to play for free after all.</p>

<p>Those key income streams would be TV rights deals, merchandise sales, and gate receipts.</p>

<p>And the truth is that gate receipts have been harsh on most sports teams over the last year.</p>

<p>However, a key way to further grow that team income, would be through opening up new ways to monetize those fans, and that’s the value proposition that Chiliz offers these sports teams, by allowing them to sell fans the right to vote on specific team decisions.</p>

<p>A form of radical fan engagement, if you will.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/1.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="win-win-for-fans-and-teams">WIN-WIN FOR FANS AND TEAMS</h2>

<p>Put simply, Chiliz offers the solution for teams to gamify team management, turn it into an entertainment proposition in its own right, and monetize the demand for these voting rights.</p>

<p>Fans on the other hand get a new way to support their team, and get given the opportunity to vote on certain team decisions, all of which impact on real world sporting events.</p>

<p>So that’s a win for the team, and for the fans, who like the idea of that opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="chiliz-ecosystem">CHILIZ ECOSYSTEM</h2>

<p>There are two key platforms that make up Chiliz.</p>

<p>The first would be <em>socios.com</em>, which is that team crowd management platform.</p>

<p>This empowers fans to take an active role in guiding various decisions, and have an influence on events for their favorite sports teams.</p>

<p>That’s all made possible by blockchain-based Fan Tokens, which allowed for secure and trustless deployment of tokenized voting rights, all executed by smart contracts on the <em>socios</em> platform.</p>

<p>So, on the <em>socios</em> app you might want to buy a Fan Token for Juventus Football Club, which would give you voting rights for certain club decisions.</p>

<p>However, those Fan Tokens also act a bit like loyalty cards, by giving you access to merchandise discounts and unique experiences.</p>

<p>That could include things like exclusive dugout access on matchdays, or getting your hands on a signed shirt from your sporting hero.</p>

<p>What’s also important to note, is that, every sports team listed on the app has its own unique Fan Token.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/1.5.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="socioscom---key-functionalities">SOCIOS.COM - KEY FUNCTIONALITIES</h2>

<p>Basically, the <em>socios</em> app has 7 key features active right now.</p>

<h5 id="1-buy-crypto">1. BUY CRYPTO</h5>

<p>The first is that, <strong>it acts as a type of fiat on-ramp into crypto</strong>.</p>

<p>You can buy Chiliz tokens via the app using <em>Mastercard</em>, <em>Visa</em>, <em>Skrill</em> and <em>Rapid</em>.</p>

<p>You’ll need Chiliz tokens to acquire the Fan Tokens for your favorite team.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/3.PNG" />
</center>

<h5 id="2-buy-sell-fan-coins">2. BUY-SELL FAN COINS</h5>

<p>Next, there’s a trading section that allows you to buy and sell those Fan Tokens.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/a.png" style="max-height: 600px" />
</center>

<h5 id="3-voting">3. VOTING</h5>

<p>Then you have that all-important voting function for those that own Fan Tokens.</p>

<p><strong>This allows you to vote on things like shirt designs, the name for training grounds, and more.</strong></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/b.png" style="max-height: 600px" />
</center>

<p>Cypriot first division side Apollon FC kind of took the concept of fan engagement to the next level.</p>

<p>In a friendly match against their rivals, the team sheet and formation were picked by their fans, using <em>socios</em>.</p>

<p>It turns out, that the fans clearly knew a thing or two with Apollon FC emerging as 6:0 victors in that match.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/5.PNG" />
</center>

<h5 id="4-rewards-for-holding-crypto---discounts-etc">4. REWARDS FOR HOLDING CRYPTO - DISCOUNTS, ETC</h5>

<p>Some of the current benefits you can access through the app, if you hold enough Fan Tokens, are things like a 20% discount on the merchandise from certain teams.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/c.png" style="max-height: 600px" />
</center>

<h5 id="5-earning-reward-tokens">5. EARNING REWARD TOKENS</h5>

<p>You can also earn reward tokens by engaging with the app, which you can redeem for exclusive club goodies.</p>

<h5 id="6-pokemon-go">6. POKEMON GO</h5>

<p>And another game in the app is socios version of <em>Pokemon Go</em>.</p>

<p>In short, you can chase down those Fan and Chiliz tokens in the real world via an augmented reality feature in the app.</p>

<p>Find those coins and you can get some of them for free.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/e.png" style="max-height: 600px" />
</center>

<h5 id="7-the-locker-room">7. THE LOCKER ROOM</h5>

<p>And finally, you can get access to something called the <strong>locker room</strong>.</p>

<p>This will be covered in a bit.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/d.png" style="max-height: 600px" />
</center>

<h2 id="supported-sports">SUPPORTED SPORTS</h2>

<p>In terms of supported sports on the app, right now the focus is on football.</p>

<p>However, some esports and basketball teams are involved with, MMA coming soon too.</p>

<p>What’s interesting is that, this model of gamification can be replicated in almost any other sports vertical.</p>

<p>So the potential here is truly massive.</p>

<h2 id="chiliz-exchange">CHILIZ EXCHANGE</h2>

<p>The second element of the Chiliz ecosystem would be the Chiliz Exchange.</p>

<p>The main draw here is all the Fan Token trading pairs, which have CHZ trading pairs only.</p>

<p>There are a few other regular crypto trading pairs, like CHZ-USDT, or CHZ-BTC, but the main focus is on trading those Fan Tokens.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/6.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Also do note, that if you want to get your hands on some Chiliz or Fan Tokens, this is going to be the cheapest exchange to buy them.</p>

<p><strong>Basically, if you’re using the CHZ trading pair to buy on the exchange, you’ll be paying 0% in fees.</strong></p>

<p>Exchange fees to sell on CHZ trading pairs are 0.6%, with other pairs being charged at 0.2% in fees.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/7.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="what-teams-have-partnered-up-with-socios-so-far">WHAT TEAMS HAVE PARTNERED UP WITH SOCIOS SO FAR?</h2>

<p>It’s obvious that many crypto veterans will be jaded by partnership announcements, which generally turn out to be nothing special or a pure scam.</p>

<p>To be fair, there are still plenty of those happening in the crypto space today, so it’s pretty reasonable.</p>

<p>The idea of Chiliz partnering up with the likes of Barcelona, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Atletico, Madrid, and AC Milan is nothing but false promises.</p>

<p>However, those with a healthy dose of skepticism only need to look at these team’s social accounts, and you can find mentions of both Chiliz and <em>socios</em>.</p>

<p>These are some of the biggest football clubs in the world, with massive fan bases, and millions of Twitter followers.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/8.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="chiliz-tokens">CHILIZ TOKENS</h2>

<p>There are 4 types of Chiliz ecosystem tokens.</p>

<p>You have those <strong>Fan Tokens</strong>, which are issued for all sports teams partnering up with Chiliz on <em>socios</em>.</p>

<p>For each team a finite number of Fan Tokens are issued, with concrete voting rights, and the ability to unlock rewards and perks mentioned earlier.</p>

<p>Fans get those voting rights by swapping Chiliz tokens for Fan Tokens, to gain decision-making rights for that team.</p>

<p><strong>So I might own a Juventus Fan Token, and that will only let me vote on Juventus related events.</strong></p>

<p>What’s super interesting here is that, these Fan Tokens have created yet another form of crypto backed fundraising - the <strong>Fan Token Offering (FTO)</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s how new partners are launched on the <em>socios.com</em> platform.</p>

<p>In short, a fixed price per Fan Token is agreed upon by <em>socios</em> and the team.</p>

<p>Then, a portion of the Fan Tokens are made available on the <em>socios</em> platform for fans to buy, and users can get them at a fixed price.</p>

<p>A bit like an ICO, IEO or IDO.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/9.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="whats-the-demand-for-such-a-token">WHAT’S THE DEMAND FOR SUCH A TOKEN?</h2>

<p>Here’s an interesting fact.</p>

<p>A recent FTO by AC Milan generated more than 6 million dollars in the first 30 minutes of launch.</p>

<p>So yes, there is some pretty crazy demand for these tokens.</p>

<p>However this is not a one-off thing.</p>

<p>In 2021 Chiliz claims, that Fan Tokens generated over 30 million dollars in revenue for sports teams and partners via FTOs in 2022.</p>

<p>Pretty handy for teams suffering from those low gate receipts due to the pandemic.</p>

<h2 id="token-burnings-incentive">TOKEN BURNINGS INCENTIVE</h2>

<p>Earlier in the year Chiliz announced Fan Token burn mechanisms.</p>

<p>Essentially, the better the team performs, and the more Fan Token holders there are, the fewer tokens that will be in circulation.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/10.png" />
</center>

<p>An example of that can be seen over here.</p>

<p>Let’s say, we hold the Barcelona Fan Tokens here.</p>

<p>20,000 of these Fan Tokens were burned per goal, and 40,000 were burned, if Barcelona won.</p>

<p>It is true, that football fans are maybe even more tribal, than the crypto community, and the demand for them seems to have been validated.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/11.jpg" />
</center>

<h2 id="tokenomics">TOKENOMICS</h2>

<p>Usually only a very small percentage of the total supply is circulating.</p>

<p>Take the Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token for example.</p>

<p>Just 6 of the 20 million total supply is circulating.</p>

<p>The rest of the tokens held by PSG Football Club have a linear vesting schedule of 8 years with 2.5 million being released per year.</p>

<p>That’s about double the current circulating supply.</p>

<p>There is surely going to be quite a bit of inflation.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/12.PNG" />
</center>

<p>After all, the same is true of Juventus Fan Tokens with just 1.3 million tokens circulating with a total supply of 20 million.</p>

<p>The rest of those Fan Tokens have that same monthly linear vesting schedule of 8 years with 2.5 million youth tokens being released every year.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/13.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Now, many sports fans don’t know about the importance of tokenomics.</p>

<p>They are likely to just buy those tokens because they like a certain team.</p>

<p>We all have friends, who are likely to be in that category.</p>

<h2 id="inflation-and-demand">INFLATION AND DEMAND</h2>

<p>So, the main question should be <em>“Will demand for fan tokens outstrip their pretty crazy inflation rate?”</em>.</p>

<p>If that’s the case, then we can expect the token price to increase.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in checking out all the different Fan Tokens and their perspective market caps, then you might want to check out <a href="https://fantokenrank.com/" target="_blank">fantokenrank.com</a>.</p>

<p>It’s basically like a <em>CoinMarketCap</em> for Fan Tokens only. Secondly you have the Chiliz or CHZ token.</p>

<h2 id="pay-attention-when-buying">PAY ATTENTION WHEN BUYING!</h2>

<p>Both an ERC-20 utility token and a BEP-2 token on the Binance Chain, so be sure not to mix things up, if you’re depositing or withdrawing from an exchange.</p>

<p>CHZ tokens are basically used as the fuel for the Chiliz ecosystem, and are used by fans to acquire those all-important Fan Tokens for any of the teams partnered with <em>socios.com</em>.</p>

<p>The way, we can think of them, is that they act in a similar way to ETH back in its crazy ICO days of 2017, except they’re for Fan Token Offerings.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/14.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="potential-future-plans-to-increase-demand">POTENTIAL FUTURE PLANS TO INCREASE DEMAND</h2>

<p>The next use case of the CHZ token hasn’t gone live yet, however, in the near future MMA fans will be able to buy UFC tickets with Chiliz tokens.</p>

<p>Chiliz will also be giving out VIP experiences for specific UFC events.</p>

<p>Those sorts of unique experiences could lead to an increase in demand for CHZ tokens.</p>

<p>That’s very unlinkely however to think, that Chiliz will expand similar options to sports teams partnered with the platform.</p>

<p>It’s also true, that CHZ can be used as a store, and transfer of value like every other cryptocurrency and they can be traded on exchanges.</p>

<h2 id="tokenomics-of-chz">TOKENOMICS OF CHZ</h2>

<p>There are not many recent information on the tokenomics, so we’ll have to use the outline from 2019.</p>

<p>That outlines that 20 of net trading fees on the Chiliz exchange will be burned, so will 10 of the net proceeds from FTOs and 20 of the proceeds from NFTs and collectibles.</p>

<p>That announcement for version 2.0 of Chiliz token economics states, that those terms for burning CHZ are valid till June 2020, when they’ll be reviewed.</p>

<p>Sadly, that’s impossible to find more recent information on that.</p>

<p>However, Chiliz did tweet earlier in 2021 that the first burn of the year was based on that token economics announcement, and that 11 million CHZ tokens had been sent to the incinerator.</p>

<p>That token burn was worth around 5.5 million dollars at the time of shooting this video.</p>

<p>Not too large an amount, given that the project commands a market cap of just over 2.5 billion.</p>

<h2 id="the-locker-room-tokens">THE LOCKER ROOM TOKENS</h2>

<p>The third type of Chiliz token would be <strong>Locker Tokens</strong>.</p>

<p>What are those?</p>

<p>In the <em>socios</em> app there’s a feature, called <em>the Socios Locker Room</em>.</p>

<p>Its purpose is to show potential partner clubs, how much demand there is for their team’s Fan Tokens.</p>

<p>It’s basically <em>socios</em> users saying “<em>Hey, Mr. Sports Club, we really want you to do a Fan Token with socios!</em>”.</p>

<p>The team at <em>socios</em> create a locker for each potential partner club.</p>

<p>These are open for 120 days.</p>

<p>Users can put CHZ tokens into the locker, and you get Locker Tokens in return.</p>

<p>If the partner decides to launch a Fan Token, then these Locker Tokens are swapped for official Fan Tokens at a rate of one to one.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/15.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="whats-the-profit-from-locker-rooms">WHAT’S THE PROFIT FROM LOCKER ROOMS?</h2>

<p>But why bother with this? What’s the incentive?</p>

<p>If a potential partner doesn’t opt to launch their Fan Token in the specified time period, then you get your CHZ tokens back.</p>

<p>However, if the club does go ahead with that, you’ve secured your allocation of Fan Tokens, and you get 10% of the money you initially invested in.</p>

<p>Bonus CHZ cashback.</p>

<p>The interesting side effect of this Locker Room mechanic is that, it essentially replicates staking by taking CHZ tokens off the open market, and reducing the tradable supply.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/16.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="erc-1155-token---for-unique-tokens">ERC-1155 TOKEN - FOR UNIQUE TOKENS</h2>

<p>The final type of token in the Chiliz ecosystem, would be the ERC-1155 NFTs.</p>

<p>Basically <em>socios</em> teamed up with engine to create Ethereum based collectibles for partner clubs.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, Chiliz also announced it had integrated with Chainlink to mint NFTs in real time.</p>

<p>So why is that a big deal?</p>

<p>It allows Chiliz to create dynamic NFTs in response to real world sporting events and mint limited edition NFTs.</p>

<p>For example, if a player scores their 100th goal then limited edition NFTs might be minted to commemorate it.</p>

<p>There are also the likes of Paris Saint-Germain tweeting about <em>socios</em> NFTs too, and here’s AC Milan letting their fans know, that they should get ready for AC Milan NFT collectibles.</p>

<h2 id="chiliz---rewards-tied-with-ntfs">CHILIZ - REWARDS TIED WITH NTFS</h2>

<p>When it comes to NFTs and sport, it all makes a ton of sense.</p>

<p>Think about the crazy money that sports fans are willing to pay for collectibles, like memorabilia and sports cards.</p>

<p>But what really sets Chiliz apart from others in the NFT space is that, they understand that NFTs need to have value, if prices are going to be supported long term.</p>

<p>At the moment, they are focused on rewards.</p>

<p>So an example of that would be the ownership of a specific Juventus NFT could lead to being granted exclusive access to a VIP box at the stadium.</p>

<p>What’s even more exciting is that, we can see how those types of NFTs could really appeal to no coiner sports fans too.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/17.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="worth-the-hype">WORTH THE HYPE?</h2>

<p>Fan Tokens are really hard to value, and that’s because sports fans can really be quite irrational, when it comes to their teams.</p>

<p>There are guys, that would spend over a thousand of dollrs and days traveling to away games in far-flung places.</p>

<p>This even though their team frankly has little hope of winning.</p>

<p>When you have fans behaving so emotionally, it’s honestly very difficult to gauge your value for these token types.</p>

<p>With the CHZ token, I think in the medium to long term that it’s very simple.</p>

<p>If the platform does well, so will the token.</p>

<p>But I would urge people to be careful, and think about their entry point, if they’re considering getting some CHZ.</p>

<p>Locker Tokens do seem like a good way to give yourself a chance of making a better return on the CHZ or you’d be interested in getting exposure to a certain Fan Token, if it was launched.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/2.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="chz-on-binance">CHZ ON BINANCE</h2>

<p>Finally, on the Chiliz NFT front.</p>

<p>It all depends on the perks, that can be unlocked by holding these NFTs.</p>

<p>If they unlock great exclusive rewards, or unique experiences, that fans really want, then no doubt, that they’ll command sky high prices.</p>

<p>Imagine the demand for an NFT amongst football fans, that allowed you to meet up with Lionel Messi once a year.</p>

<p>Every fan and football youtuber under the sun would want a piece of that one.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/18.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="partneships">PARTNESHIPS</h2>

<p>But what about Chiliz partnerships?</p>

<p>Well, there is a very important one.</p>

<p>Binance is both a partner and investor in Chiliz.</p>

<p>That’s why almost every Fan Token and the CHZ token is listed on Binance.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/19.PNG" />
</center>

<p>It also gave access to certain Fan Tokens, like PSG and you have on the Binance launch pool.</p>

<p>If liquidity is something that concerns you, then honestly it’s worth considering trading them on Binance every day of the week.</p>

<p>That trade volume and liquidity is typically way better, than the Chiliz exchange itself.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/20.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Probably not a surprise to anyone out there, also Binance frankly offers way more trading pairs.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/21.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="fans-are-good-customers">FANS ARE GOOD CUSTOMERS</h2>

<p>Honestly, I know firsthand, how passionate sports fans can be.</p>

<p>I wonder, if fan tokens could end up becoming a bit like how diamonds are.</p>

<p>More or bigger diamonds equals more love or, in terms of Fan Tokens, that would be more Fan Tokens, the bigger a supporter you really are.</p>

<p>Let’s face it, there are billions of sports fans out there in the world, and almost everyone I know seems to love the idea of being able to influence their team’s decisions and get exclusive perks.</p>

<p>Overall, Chiliz as a project is really ambitious, the concept, and how they’re seemingly paving the way for unique digital sports memorabilia with NFTs in real time.</p>

<p>Also the idea of attaching tangible team-related perks to NFTs is absolutely brilliant.</p>

<p>That way they have tangible real-world value, and this should drive future demand.</p>

<p>There are plenty of countries in the world, where gambling on sports is illegal.</p>

<p>Think of the likes of China, where people are football crazy.</p>

<p>What Fan Tokens also allow people to do, is to speculate on the success of teams.</p>

<p>Due to that, Fan Token burn mechanism, and how in theory teams should be more popular the more they win.</p>

<p>In a way, it’s kind of like an indirect way of betting on them too.</p>

<h2 id="expanding---how-crazy-would-that-be">EXPANDING - HOW CRAZY WOULD THAT BE?</h2>

<p>There are billions of sports fans around the world.</p>

<p>The majority would probably be open to using a platform like <em>socios</em>.</p>

<p>That’s a a lot of new people, who could be introduced to the world of crypto, and that’s what makes Chiliz so intriguing as a platform.</p>

<p>Also think about this potential to add more teams and sports.</p>

<p>Accoring to the rumours, Chiliz might be planning on expanding into the US with a 50 million dollar investment.</p>

<p>How crazy that could be, if they got some big F1 teams onto the platform.</p>

<p>But with all that being said, I do believe that Chiliz long-term success rests on voting power, and rewards, that fans really care about.</p>

<p>In a crazy world, where anything seems possible, is it really so far-fetched to think that even major decisions, like transfers team sheets and formations, could be decided by fans in the future.</p>

<p>That’s perhaps something almost every sports fan would be interested in.</p>

<h2 id="history-of-japanese-rice-trader">HISTORY OF JAPANESE RICE TRADER</h2>

<p>Technical analysis actually has some solid science behind it, and has existed for hundreds of years.</p>

<p>The candlestick chart, that comes to mind, when thinking of trading, is said to have been invented by a Japanese rice merchant named <em>Honma Munehisa</em> almost 300 years ago.</p>

<p>Honma wrote what is believed to be the first book on <em>market psychology</em>, which details many of the patterns and terminologies expert traders continue to use to this day.</p>

<p>He’s believed to be the most successful trader, who ever lived, reportedly banging over 10 billion in today’s dollars over the course of his trading career.</p>

<p>That’s not so hard to believe, considering that he was probably the only person on the planet at the time, who had an in-depth understanding of the ebb and flow of commodity markets.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/0.jpg" />
</center>

<h2 id="human-psychology-is-the-critical-factor">HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY IS THE CRITICAL FACTOR</h2>

<p>But it wasn’t just Honma’s first mover status, that made his trading so successful.</p>

<p>It was his understanding that human psychology is what fundamentally moves any given market.</p>

<p>Emotions like <strong>fear and greed</strong> follow surprisingly consistent patterns, and with the right analysis, these patterns can not only be easily seen on a candlestick chart, they can also be predicted.</p>

<h2 id="other-factors-worth-keeping-in-mind">OTHER FACTORS WORTH KEEPING IN MIND</h2>

<p>Although technical analysis has proven itself to be a powerful trading tool, there are other factors one should keep in mind, when it comes to crafting a trading strategy for cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>This includes things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tokenomics,</li>
  <li>network activity,</li>
  <li>use case,</li>
  <li>the team behind the cryptocurrency,</li>
  <li>any notable partnerships it has,</li>
  <li>and even macro indicators, like Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow model, and Bitcoin dominance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Evaluating these factors is called <strong>fundamental analysis</strong>, because <strong>it focuses on more objective measures of an asset’s potential value.</strong></p>

<h2 id="fundamental-analysis-vs-technical-analysis">FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS VS TECHNICAL ANALYSIS</h2>

<p>In contrast to fundamental analysis, technical analysis focuses almost exclusively on price action.</p>

<p>Pumps and dumps are ultimately caused by the irrational emotions of the people holding an asset, fundamentals be damned.</p>

<p>Some would argue, that technical analysis is the more accurate way to trade cryptocurrencies, given that the average cryptocurrency holder is exponentially more irrational, than the Wall Street investors.</p>

<p>However, each cryptocurrency will require its own special blend of fundamental analysis and technical analysis in its price projections.</p>

<p>It will be up to <em>you</em> to figure out, how much emphasis you should be putting on one versus the other.</p>

<p>Most of this will be determined by how long you plan to hold that cryptocurrency for.</p>

<p><strong>As a rule of thumb, technical analysis is used for shorter term trading, and fundamental analysis is used for longer term trading and hodling.</strong></p>

<h2 id="trading-pairs-as-an-indicatpr-of-performance">TRADING PAIRS AS AN INDICATPR OF PERFORMANCE</h2>

<p>It’s worth remembering that although stablecoin trading pairs, like ETH-USDT are the easiest to keep track of an asset, in terms of dollar value, trading pairs with Bitcoin, such as ETH-BTC can often a better sense of how well a cryptocurrency is performing relative to others.</p>

<p>This is obviously pertaining to altcoins.</p>

<h2 id="candles">CANDLES</h2>

<p>Almost everything in technical analysis involves the candlestick chart.</p>

<p>When it comes to trading, each candle you see on that graph, in a standard cryptocurrency exchange gives you a snapshot of the trading activity within a given unit of time.</p>

<p>For example, if you have the chart set for one hour, each candle will represent one hour of trading activity for that asset pair.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, a green candle mean prices went up during that period, and a red candle means that prices went down.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/1.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Almost all the candles will have something called a <strong>body</strong> and a <strong>wick</strong>.</p>

<p>The body is the thicker part of the candle, and the wick are those lines poking from the top or the bottom.</p>

<p>For green candles, the bottom of the body is the price, that the trading started at, during the time period, and for red candles it’s the top of the body.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/2.PNG" />
</center>

<p>When you see a candle, as above, it means, that almost all of the trading during that time period took place within a very narrow price range.</p>

<p>This means that the price did not change during that time.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/3.PNG" />
</center>

<p>When you see a candle that’s almost all body with no wicks, that means price either moved to the upside or to the downside during that period.</p>

<p>The bigger these candles are the more fomo or fud investors feel.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/4.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Wicks on a candle denote the highest and lowest trading prices during that time frame.</p>

<p>These wicks are incredibly useful, because they can tell, when traders are taking profits or buying the dip.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/5.PNG" />
</center>

<p>A long wick on the bottom of a candle suggests, that traders are buying the dip, meaning price could still be bullish.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/6.PNG" />
</center>

<p>A long wick at the top of a candle suggests, that traders are itching to take profits, which could be foreshadowing a shakeout.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/7.PNG" />
</center>

<p>However, it’s only when you factor in trading volume, that you can really start making price predictions with candlestick charts.</p>

<h2 id="trading-volume">TRADING VOLUME</h2>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/8.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Factoring in trading volume is critical for good technical analysis.</p>

<p>Each volume bar you see at the bottom of a trading window, shows you <strong>the amount of an asset, that was traded during the time frame you’ve set.</strong></p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/9.PNG" />
</center>

<p>As a general rule of thumb, you want to be trading on a market with lots of volume.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/10.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Low volume tends to lead to price volatility, meaning that price could suddenly spike up or down.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/11.PNG" />
</center>

<p><strong>Volume is the first thing you should look at, when you’re considering buying some hot altcoin.</strong></p>

<p>On a shady cryptocurrency exchange some lesser-known exchanges will even set longer default trading time periods to hide low liquidity and questionable price action.</p>

<hr />

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/12.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Make sure that you still see a high amount of trading volume with shorter time frames, before throwing your money into the void.</p>

<h2 id="price-trend-due-to-volume">PRICE TREND DUE TO VOLUME</h2>

<p>Volume is used by many traders to confirm a price trend.</p>

<p>For example, imagine you see the price of your favorite altcoin steadily dropping most of the candlesticks in the last few hours or days.</p>

<p>Have been read and it’s not getting any better.</p>

<p>Without looking at the volume, you might think this means you’re headed for some hurt.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/13.PNG" style="max-height:500px" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>But when you check the volume, and you see that as price continues to drop, trading volume is also dropping.</p>

<p>This means that the downtrend you see is not very strong, despite what the price action might have.</p>

<p>You believe the bulls are standing by, and once the volume drops low enough, volatility kicks back in and the bulls are off to the races.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/14.PNG" style="max-height:500px" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>The same is true, if the price is rising and trading volume is decreasing.</p>

<p>This means that there’s only a matter of time, before volatility strikes, and that could bring a strong reversal in price action.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/x.PNG" style="max-height:500px" />
</center>

<h2 id="common-patterns-found-in-trading">COMMON PATTERNS FOUND IN TRADING</h2>

<p>Now, let’s take a closer look at some of the common patterns found in trading.</p>

<p>When traders draw lines, they’re normally looking for three things.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Support</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Resistance</strong></li>
  <li>and a <strong>Recognizable Price Pattern</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="support">SUPPORT</h3>

<p>Support refers to the <strong>lower limit</strong> of where the price of an asset could go.</p>

<h3 id="resistance">RESISTANCE</h3>

<p>Resistance refers to the <strong>upper limit</strong> of where the price of an asset could go.</p>

<p>There are many ways to assess, where the support and resistant prices could be.</p>

<p>The simplest method is to look at the lowest and highest prices hit during a given time period.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/15.png" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>If you draw a resistance line across the tops, and a support line across the bottoms, it will give you a sense, of how much volatility the market could experience.</p>

<p>Going forward, which direction the price is likely moving, and even when to sell and when to buy.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/16.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>More often than not drawing these support and resistance lines reveals a recognizable price pattern.</p>

<p>There are dozens of price patterns, and most of these have stood the test of time continuing to repeat themselves in every market.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/17.jpg" />
</center>

<p>Ever since Honma Munihisa first defined, them almost 300 years ago, of all these patterns <strong>Triangle Patterns</strong> are considered to be the most reliable by professional traders.</p>

<p><strong>Triangle is created every time support and resistant lines converge.</strong></p>

<p>The two most common Triangle Patterns are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ascending Triangles, and</li>
  <li>Descending Triangles</li>
</ul>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/18.png" />
</center>

<p>In an <strong>Ascending Triangle</strong>, the resistance line is more or less flat, and the support line is angled upwards.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/20.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>In a <strong>Descending Triangle</strong> the resistance line is angled downwards and the support line is flat.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/21.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>Why are these triangles so important?</p>

<p>When the current price reaches the edge of an Ascending Triangle, price tends to spike upwards, and when it reaches the edge of a Descending Triangle, the price tends to drop.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/22.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>Oddly enough, you can often use the left side of the triangle to determine, just how much the price will change to the upside or to the downside.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/21.5.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="techncial-indicators">TECHNCIAL INDICATORS</h2>

<p>If this feels a bit too arbitrary, you can use a number of technical indicators to help you double check, if you’re on the right track.</p>

<p>With your support and resistance lines, there are literally hundreds of different indicators, that people use in technical analysis trading.</p>

<p>Some of these are free to use, and others you will have to pay for.</p>

<p>Unless you’re planning on being the next wolf of wall street, free technical indicators will be more than enough to build a robust trading strategy.</p>

<p>There are 4 technical indicators, that you should know if you want to effectively trade cryptocurrency:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Moving Averages,</li>
  <li>the MACD,</li>
  <li>the RSI, and</li>
  <li>Bollinger Bands.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="emas">EMAs</h2>

<p>Moving Average indicators draw the average price of an asset over a given period of time.</p>

<p>Exponential Moving Averages, or EMAs are commonly used in technical analysis trading.</p>

<p>Without getting into the details, EMAs put more weight on more recent prices when projecting a trend, and react faster to price changes.</p>

<p>Many traders believe EMAs to be the most useful Moving Average indicators.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/25.PNG" />
</center>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/24.jpg" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>For this reason, EMAs, especially the 200-day EMA, are considered to be very important price zones for many traders.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/25.1.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>If the current price of a cryptocurrency is below its 200-day EMA, then it might see some resistance, when it hits the 200-day EMA line.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/26.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>In contrast, if the price of a cryptocurrency is above its 200-day EMA, the 200-day EMA line is often considered to be a strong zone of price support.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/27.PNG" style="max-height:400px" />
</center>

<p>The reasoning here is that, the market has basically agreed that the fair price for that cryptocurrency is somewhere within that range, as evidenced by the aggregated price action.</p>

<hr />

<p>When a short-term Moving Average, such as the 20-day EMA crosses the 200-day Moving Average from above, this is called a <strong>Death Cross</strong> and signals to traders, that we’re headed for a downturn in that market.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/28.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>Bitcoin experienced a Death Cross just over a week before the flash crash in March 2020, where it dropped by 60% in price.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/31.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>When a shorter term Moving Average, such as the 20-day EMA crosses the 200-day Moving Average from below, this is called a <strong>Golden Cross</strong> and signals that there are many green days ahead for that market.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/29.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>Bitcoin experienced the Golden Cross in May 2020.</p>

<p>Its price jumped from 8,000 to 1,0000 shortly afterwards, and has been in an uptrend ever since.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/30.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="macd">MACD</h2>

<p>There is another powerful technical indicator based on Moving Averages called the MACD.</p>

<p><strong>MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence.</strong></p>

<p>It’s used to determine new trends in price and measure price volatility.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/32.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>Briefly about BTC, <strong>when the two lines you see are far apart it means, that price volatility is low.</strong></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/33.PNG" style="max-height:500px" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>The closer those lines are together, the higher the volatility.</p>

<p>If those two lines cross this indicates, that the price is going to change direction, in the coming hours or days, and the direction of the bars, you see, will tell you which way the price is likely to go.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/34.PNG" style="max-height:500px" />
</center>

<h2 id="rsi">RSI</h2>

<p>Now, for my personal favorite, the RSI short for Relative Strength Index.</p>

<p>The RSI is a favorite among cryptocurrency traders.</p>

<p><strong>This is because it tells you if a cryptocurrency is overvalued or undervalued.</strong></p>

<p>The RSI indicator is drawn within a number range of naught to 100.</p>

<p>You can see this on the right hand side of the RSI’s indicator window.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/35.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p><strong>If the current position of the indicator is below 30, this means that the cryptocurrency you’re looking at is probably undervalued.</strong></p>

<p>In other words, it’s time to <strong>buy</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/36.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p><strong>However, if the indicator is positioned over 70, the crypto you’re looking at is entering bubble territory.</strong></p>

<p>It’s time to <strong>sell</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/37.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>The trend of the RSI line will give you a sense of whether the cryptocurrency, you’re looking at, is becoming overvalued or undervalued as time goes on.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/38.PNG" style="max-height:500px" />
</center>

<p>As long, as you’re within the 30 to 70 range, the price is right.</p>

<h2 id="bollinger-band-indicator">BOLLINGER BAND INDICATOR</h2>

<p>Finally, the Bollinger Band indicator.</p>

<p>Like the MACD, the Bollinger Band indicator is used to measure market volatility.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/40.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>In contrast to the MACD, <strong>the wider the lines are on the Bollinger Band Indicator, the more volatility there is</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/41.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Traders, who use the Bollinger Band will generally buy, when there is low volatility, and sell, when there is high volatility, assuming price has gone to the upside during that volatile period.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/42.PNG" />
</center>

<hr />

<p>If you notice that its price is outside of the indicators range, its high time to buy or sell, depending on whether the price is pushing beneath or piercing through the top of the indicator’s range.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/43.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="technical-indicators">TECHNICAL INDICATORS</h2>

<p>Using the various EMAs, the MACD, the RSI, and the Bollinger Band in tandem, should give you all the information you need, to execute effective short-term trades on your favorite cryptos.</p>

<p>Just remember that what you see, can, and probably will, change the second you adjust the time frame.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/analysis/44.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>It’s going to take lots of time, lots of practice, and lots of patience to build a solid trading strategy.</p>

<p>So, to sum up:</p>

<p><strong>Candlestick charts show you much more than basic price action.</strong></p>

<p>They can show things like, whether people are buying the dip or taking profits.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing trend lines on candlestick charts reveals patterns that have repeated themselves in the markets for hundreds of years.</strong></p>

<p>These will help give you a sense of where the price might be heading.</p>

<p><strong>Taking note of the trading volume will confirm whether that price action is genuine or not.</strong></p>

<p>Moving Averages, the MACD, the RSI, and the Bollinger Band will help <strong>add some perspective to your initial calculations, by giving a more accurate picture of price volatility, identify any possible bubbles, or buying opportunities, and warn you of any incoming crashes or moonshots.</strong></p>

<p>It’s for best to double check the time frames you’re working with, and remember, that you’ll probably have to use slightly different trading strategies for different cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>It’s also important to remember, that technical indicators are not the be-all and end-all of cryptocurrency trading, and keeping the fundamentals in mind will go a long way, to helping make sure you see more green, than red over the long term.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more to cryptocurrency trading however - Sentiment Analysis, Whale Movements, Fibonacci Retracements, etc.</p>

<p>But that’s for another time.</p>

<h2 id="international-transactions">INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS</h2>

<p>Ripple and XRP are one of the leading cryptocurrencies around.</p>

<p>Have you ever had occasion where you needed to wire money to someone only to be told it might take several days for that money to appear in their account?</p>

<p>That’s because most major banks are still using systems that were built 40 years ago for this task.</p>

<p>Swift, MoneyGram and Western Union are just some examples of slow, expensive  and relatively limited systems that financial services use  to transfer money.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/0.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="transaction-going-through-intermediary-banks">TRANSACTION GOING THROUGH INTERMEDIARY BANKS</h2>

<p>On top of that, not all of the banks are connected  via the same network.</p>

<p>So, in many cases, you don’t even have a direct line between two banks when they need to transfer money from one account to the other.</p>

<p>In order for bank A to send money to bank B that it doesn’t have any direct relationship with, more often than not it will have to go through several intermediary banks, searching for common network connections between each other in order to clear a path for the money.</p>

<p>That’s why international wire transfers are so slow and costly.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/1.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="money-conversations">MONEY CONVERSATIONS</h2>
<p>Each bank along the way takes time to process the transaction and a fee for servicing the process.</p>

<p>In some cases, bank transfers must involve currency conversions, which make things  even more problematic and expensive.</p>

<p>For example, directly transferring currency from Japan to Nicaragua, means turning Yens into Cordobas, which is generally not feasible.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/2.PNG" />
</center>

<p>The reason is that Japanese banks don’t usually hold accounts denominated in Cordobas because there’s not a lot of demand for them.</p>

<p>However, both Japanese and Nicaraguan banks hold accounts in dollars.</p>

<p>So instead, an individual or bank will usually trade Yens for Dollars and then Dollars to Cordobas.</p>

<p>As one can imagine, this process can be costly due to the multiple conversions.</p>

<h2 id="ripple-for-banks-to-transfer-cash-around-the-world">RIPPLE FOR BANKS TO TRANSFER CASH AROUND THE WORLD</h2>

<p>In short, the banking system today doesn’t have a main connecting network  with a uniform set of rules.</p>

<p>Each time you want to exchange  or send money through the banking system, you need to find a path to transfer that money, depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>That’s exactly what Ripple is here to change.</p>

<p>Just like the Internet has its own rules, or protocol, to transfer information known as HTTP, RippleNet uses a protocol known as <strong>RTXP</strong>, for moving value around the world.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/3.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="ripplenet">RIPPLENET</h2>

<p>Ripple Labs, the creators of RippleNet, aim to create the “Internet of Value” - a way for money to move as quickly as information does.</p>

<p>Through the use of RippleNet, there is no reason to pay a fortune and wait days when transferring money globally.</p>

<p>The idea for Ripple was actually first conceived way back in 2004 by Ryan Fugger and was called RipplePay, but in 2012 was passed to Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen who founded OpenCoin later to be called Ripple Labs.</p>

<p>Unlike most cryptocurrencie,s who focus on the individual, <strong>Ripple Labs aims to serve banks and payment providers, allowing them to lower transaction costs  and expedite settlements.</strong></p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work-validators-gateways">HOW DOES IT WORK? VALIDATORS, GATEWAYS</h2>

<p><strong>RippleNet is a network based on a set of rules known as the Ripple Transaction Protocol or RTXP for short.</strong></p>

<p>The network consists of computers, known as validators, that are spread around the world and maintain a shared ledger of who owns what.</p>

<p>Validators make sure every transaction sent through the network follows the RTXP rules.</p>

<p>Anyone can run a validator and help maintain the Ripple network just like anyone can run a Bitcoin node to maintain the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Companies who want to access the Ripple network can use gateways.</p>

<p><strong>Gateways, which are usually run by banks, act as entry points to Ripple for people outside the network.</strong></p>

<p>It’s the same idea as going to a bank or a credit company to gain access to the banking system.</p>

<p><strong>So Ripple basically offers businesses an alternative to the banking system in the form of an Internet of value called RippleNet.</strong></p>

<h2 id="our-money-can-be-on-xrp-and-we-might-not-know">OUR MONEY CAN BE ON XRP AND WE MIGHT NOT KNOW</h2>

<p>Ripple products like <strong>xRapid</strong>, <strong>xVia</strong> and <strong>xCurrent</strong> are offered to companies in order to optimize their current solutions for transfering money around the world.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/5.PNG" />
</center>

<p>It’s worth mentioning that for you, as a customer of a financial service  using Ripple, this solution is transparent.</p>

<p>If the bank switches to this technology, your bank account balance  could be residing on the XRP ledger tomorrow and you would never know it.</p>

<h2 id="two-types-of-currency">TWO TYPES OF CURRENCY</h2>

<p>This all sounds great, but what type of currency  can actually be sent through the Ripple Network?</p>

<p>Unlike other cryptocurrency protocols, which support only their own asset, Ripple offers two different types of currencies: IOUs and XRP.</p>

<h2 id="iou">IOU</h2>

<p>IOUs are tokens on the Ripple network  that can be stored on any Ripple wallet.</p>

<p>Just like we can store a variety of Ethereum tokens on an Ethereum wallet, we can have plenty of tokens coexisting on the same Ripple wallet.</p>

<p>But we really should stop the comparison here, since this is as far as the similarities go.</p>

<p>Any participant on the Ripple network can issue an IOU, however an IOU doesn’t represent something you OWN.</p>

<p>It represents something you OWE.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/7.PNG" />
</center>

<p>It’s a debt, an obligation to pay back something you got in real life.</p>

<p>When I issue an IOU to someone, it means I owe them something.</p>

<p>When I hold an IOU issued by someone else, it means someone owes me something.</p>

<p>Each IOU has a name that is comprised out of who issued it and what it represents.</p>

<p>For example, USD.Bitstamp is an IOU issued by Bitstamp promising to pay back USD dollars.</p>

<p>An IOU can be issued for any type of real world asset.</p>

<p>For example you can have an IOU for dollars, EUROs, gold, oil, airline miles and even cows.</p>

<p>For each asset we borrow, we will issue a new IOU.</p>

<p>Unlike other forms of debt that can be traded, IOUs for the same asset type  are not interchangeable if they were issued by two different people.</p>

<p>For example, if I borrow money from you and issue you a 20 USD.Nate IOU, that IOU can’t be added to a 20 USD.Bitstamp IOU.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/8.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="depends-on-trust">DEPENDS ON TRUST</h2>

<p>Since each IOU has a different credit line or trust line, you can only redeem  the USD.Nate IOU from me.</p>

<p><strong>It’s important to note that  the IOU itself is not the asset, it’s just a promise by the issuer  to give you the asset back in the future.</strong></p>

<p>This promise won’t do you any good, if the issuer isn’t good for his word.</p>

<p>That’s why trust plays an important issue with IOUs.</p>

<p>In order for you to accept an IOU from someone, you have to trust that they will be able to pay you back.</p>

<p>In RippleNet this is known as a <strong>trust line</strong>.</p>

<p>A trust line is somewhat similar to a line of credit with the bank.</p>

<p><strong>It’s an agreement to trust someone up to a limited amount of money.</strong></p>

<h2 id="xrp">XRP</h2>

<p>Aside from IOUs there is another currency the Ripple protocol supports - XRP.</p>

<p>XRP is a currency issued by Ripple Labs to help transfer payments through the Ripple Network.</p>

<p>For example, if a bank wants to move large amounts of money, instead of needing to use  multiple intermediary banks to transfer the money, it can just convert the money to XRP and send that XRP to the recipient bank.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that two banks don’t have to use XRP to transfer assets between them.</p>

<p>Instead, they can choose to keep  an ‘open tab’ using IOUs only, without ever closing it.</p>

<h2 id="tradable-asset-and-no-trust-needed">TRADABLE ASSET AND NO TRUST NEEDED</h2>

<p>Still, XRP is a form of payment that unlike an IOU is final and is considered a tradable asset by anyone on the network.</p>

<p>Unlike IOUs, XRP is the actual asset so there is no counterparty risk.</p>

<p>In other words, once you’ve received payment in XRP, the transaction is made and there’s no fear that the other party will not meet its obligations for payment.</p>

<h2 id="if-xrp-is-so-cool-why-iou">IF XRP IS SO COOL, WHY IOU?</h2>

<p>So, if no trust is needed and no trust line needs to be opened when sending XRP to other network participants, why do we even need IOU?</p>

<p>The simple answer is that <strong>XRP, being a cryptocurrency asset by itself, is relatively volatile and also not respected worldwide.</strong></p>

<p>IOUs, on the other hand, are treated and valued as the assets each represent.</p>

<h2 id="more-pros-of-xrp">MORE PROS OF XRP</h2>

<p>XRP has additional advantages as well.</p>

<p>It’s fast and scalable.</p>

<p>Sending an XRP transaction through the network takes 4 seconds as opposed to Bitcoin’s 10 minute average.</p>

<p>Also, XRP can handle 1,500 transactions per second, while Bitcoin can handle only 7.</p>

<p>So the upside of using XRP as a form of payment is pretty obvious.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/9.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="can-xrp-be-mined">CAN XRP BE MINED?</h2>

<p>So, if XRP is a cryptocurrency, can it be mined?</p>

<p>The answer is - <strong>no, it can’t.</strong></p>

<p>Mining in Bitcoin is done in order to confirm and determine the order of transactions on the blockchain.</p>

<p>In Ripple transactions are handled through a different process.</p>

<h2 id="validators-rules-the-blockchain">VALIDATORS RULES THE BLOCKCHAIN</h2>

<p>When an XRP transaction is broadcast through the network, the validators that maintain the network decide if it’s valid or not through <strong>voting</strong>.</p>

<p>When a validator receives the transaction, it consults with other trusted validators and they vote on whether the transaction is valid.</p>

<p>If <strong>80% or more vote it “valid”</strong> - the transaction is updated in the Ripple ledger.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/10.PNG" />
</center>

<p><strong>This list of trusted validators  that a validator consults with is known as a Unique Node List or UNL for short.</strong></p>

<p>Each validator has its own UNL.</p>

<p>Deciding who will be included in the validaor’s UNL is completely up to the person  who runs the validator.</p>

<p>However, Ripple offers a default list of trusted validators.</p>

<p><strong>Validators don’t get compensated for their work like Bitcoin miners do with new coins.</strong></p>

<h2 id="xrp-is-pre-mined">XRP IS PRE-MINED</h2>

<p>When Ripple Labs started out they actually issued, or “pre-mined”, a total of 100 billion XRP and according to the Ripple protocol, no more XRP can ever be created.</p>

<p>Who owns all of these pre-mined coins?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>20 Billion XRP were given to Ripple founders - Jed Macaleb, Chris Larsen and Arthur Britto.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ripple Labs holds around 7 billion XRP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>40 billion XRP have been sold  to companies and individuals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The remaining supply is sealed in a smart contract that releases 1 billion XRP into Ripple Labs’ hands each month.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Until all of the 100 billion XRP cap  will be reached, that is.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/11.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="xrp-extra-facts">XRP EXTRA FACTS</h2>

<p>XRP can be divided into 6 decimal points with the smallest unit being known as a <strong>drop</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to hold XRP you will need a wallet that supports the currency and a <strong>minimum deposit of 20 XRP</strong> in your account.</p>

<p>This is done in order to prevent people from spamming the Ripple Network by opening a large number of accounts.</p>

<p>One last thing to know about XRP is that the <strong>XRP supply decreases over time making it, in theory, more valuable as time passes.</strong></p>

<p>This is done through destroying the transaction fees attached to each XRP transaction.</p>

<p>For example, at the beginning of 2021 we were down to about 99.99% of the original 100 Billion XRP.</p>

<p>The “missing” XRP are transaction fees that have been destroyed and can never be used again.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/12.PNG" />
</center>

<h2 id="is-it-a-good-investition">IS IT A GOOD INVESTITION?</h2>

<p>When people invest in XRP they are basically betting that in the future banks and institutions will use XRP to move value and will therefore buy XRP and drive up its price.</p>

<p>Of course, banks could always use IOUs instead and that will keep XRP’s price  rather stagnant.</p>

<p>Therefore, the question of  “will XRP rise in value?”, is mainly a question of whether a majority of banks and payment providers choose to utilize it instead of their current infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-decentralized">IS IT DECENTRALIZED?</h2>

<p>Let’s see at the criticism about Ripple being a centralized platform.</p>

<p>There are many arguments for both sides, but I will try to display some of the main points of debate.</p>

<h2 id="key-points">KEY POINTS</h2>

<h4 id="-no-cnotrol-over-the-protocol">(+) NO CNOTROL OVER THE PROTOCOL</h4>

<p>Just like Bitcoin, <strong>once Ripple’s protocol is published, Ripple Labs has no control over it</strong>.</p>

<p>Validators run the code themselves.</p>

<p>This is pretty similar to Bitcoin’s core development team maintaining the Bitcoin protocol but having no real control over the nodes that run it.</p>

<h4 id="---but-still-has-something-to-say">(-) … BUT STILL HAS SOMETHING TO SAY</h4>
<p>But <strong>while Ripple Labs doesn’t control the protocol, it does have a lot of influence</strong> since it is the organization maintaining it.</p>

<p>So, if for some good reason it determined to create more coins, it might succeed.</p>

<p>Ripple Labs is sort of a central bank for RippleNet.</p>

<h4 id="-validators-above-ripple-labs">(+) VALIDATORS ABOVE RIPPLE LABS</h4>

<p><strong>The Ripple protocol itself is open source</strong>, meaning that if Ripple Labs ceases to exist, the validators can still run the network themselves.</p>

<h4 id="--products-arent-open-source-though">(-) PRODUCTS AREN’T OPEN SOURCE THOUGH</h4>

<p>On the other hand, <strong>products the company offers to banks and institutions aren’t open source and are run solely by Ripple Labs</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="--only-few-validators">(-) ONLY FEW VALIDATORS</h4>

<p><strong>The number of Ripple validators today is relatively small</strong>, and is a fraction of the number of Bitcoin nodes that maintain the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>Since these relatively few validators are ultimately responsible for maintaining the integrity of the network, this raises the question: how can we know the validators aren’t colluding in order to defraud Ripple’s users?</p>

<h5 id="-i-ou-tokens-demanding-trust">(-)I OU TOKENS DEMANDING TRUST</h5>

<p>Another attribute in Ripple that raises concern is that <strong>you ultimately have to depend on trust in order to use the IOU tokens</strong>.</p>

<p>In contrast, Bitcoin’s entire system is designed to work in a trustless environment.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/13.PNG" />
</center>

<h4 id="--ripple-monitors-and-reports-suspicious-activity-to-authorities">(-) RIPPLE MONITORS AND REPORTS SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY TO AUTHORITIES</h4>

<p>Additionally, while Bitcoin is free for all and censorship resistant, <strong>Ripple is committed to monitoring and reporting any Anti-Money Laundering flags  across the network, as well as reporting suspicious activity to relevant authorities</strong>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/14.PNG" />
</center>

<h4 id="-more-energy-efficient-since-theres-no-mining">(+) MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT SINCE THERE’S NO MINING</h4>

<p>On the upside, since there’s no such thing as Ripple mining, <strong>the network itself is much more energy efficient</strong> compared to Bitcoin’s extreme energy consumption.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">FINAL THOUGHTS</h2>

<p>In the end, there’s no clear answer to  whether Ripple is decentralized or not.</p>

<p>The real question of centralization arises when there’s one key figure or company that has implicit power  over what the community thinks.</p>

<p><strong>And in this case, Ripple Labs undoubtedly has the most influence on the entire Ripple community, making it much more centralized in nature than Bitcoin.</strong></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/ripple/15.PNG" />
</center>

<p>It’s up to you to decide if you think Ripple is centralized or not, or whether that even matters.</p>

<p>Ripple isn’t built on the same ideals as Bitcoin. It’s a ‘for profit’ company, serving the banking system.</p>

<p>Perhaps this centralized solution is a more efficient means of international transaction, but is it the right one?</p>

<p>Summing up: <strong>Ripple is a network designed to move value around the world, mainly aimed at banks and payment providers.</strong></p>

<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/tokenomics/tokenomics.jpeg" style="max-width: 600px" />
</center>

<h2 id="tokenomics">TOKENOMICS</h2>
<p><strong>Tokenomics mean Token Economics.</strong></p>

<p>It includes a whole series of metrics relating to cryptocurrency, coin or token, such as <em>supply</em>, <em>allocation</em>, <em>distribution</em>, <em>emission</em> and <em>utility</em>.</p>

<p>Coins are used to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pay fees on their native network,</li>
  <li>transfer value,</li>
  <li>are given as a reward to miners when a new block is mined.</li>
</ul>

<p>Instead of being used for baseline newtwork activities, like fee payments, tokens often have unique use cases, that are specific to the projects, that made them.</p>

<p><em>For example: Decentraland’s MANA token which is burned to purchase digital assets on the Decentraland Marketplace.</em></p>

<h2 id="supply">SUPPLY</h2>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/tokenomics/1.PNG" />
</center>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/tokenomics/2.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Dogecoin is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap, even though the dollar value of each coin is low.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/tokenomics/3.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Other crypto, like Yarn.finance’s YFI token, have a small supply, and its why one YFI is worth more than one BTC, even though it has 1/4 of the market cap of Dogecoin.</p>

<p>Therefore YFI has more potential to grow compared to Dogecoin.</p>

<p>This is because its easier for a cryptocurrency with a market cap of 1.3 billion to double in value, than a crypto with a market cap of 7.3 billion.</p>

<p>Each crypto’s market cap is calculated by multyplying the number of coins or tokens in circulation with the currenct price of that coin or token.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/tokenomics/4.PNG" />
</center>

<p><strong>In circulation</strong> means <em>wihout the tokens, that hasn’t been mined yet or are locked</em>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/tokenomics/4.5.PNG" />
</center>

<p><strong>Fully diluted valuation</strong> - theoretical market cap of the crypto, if every coin or token was in circulation.</p>

<h2 id="allocation-and-distribution">ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION</h2>

<p>Cryptocurerncies are created in two ways</p>
<ul>
  <li>by fair launch,</li>
  <li>bypre-mine a fair launch.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Fair launch</strong> - a small community of people start collectively mining a coin or token (BTC, Litecoin, Dogecoin). No coin or token accolactions for fair launch cryptos. Allocation is relevant to any crypto that was premined.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-mine</strong> is when the team behind the project mint some or all of the coins or tokens before opening up the network to the public. A portion of these pre-mined coins or tokens is usually sold prior to the launch of the network to raise the funds needed to build it.</p>

<p>Many of the coins seen today were originally sold as tokens. Specifically ERC20 tokens on ethereum.</p>

<p><strong>ICO - initial coin offering. Also a good way to promote new tokens.</strong></p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/tokenomics/5.PNG" />
</center>

<p>Distribution of ETH. The ones in boxes are smart contracts, not actual wallets.</p>

<h2 id="vesting-and-inflation">VESTING AND INFLATION</h2>

<p>Applies to pre-mined cryptocurrencies and refers to how the coins or tokens are expected to be allocated over the coming months or years.</p>

<p>It’s common for cryptocurrency projects with a pre-mine to lock up a certain portion of their tokens and gradually release them over time. This increases the confidence of regular token holders, that the market won’t be flooded by tokens allocated to the team and private investors.</p>

<p>Usually these vesting schedules are pretty logical and take place over many years.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/tokenomics/6.PNG" />
</center>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/tokenomics/7.PNG" />
</center>

<p><strong>CAREFUL WITH THE GRAPH AS THE ONE ABOVE!</strong></p>

<p>Unlocking too many tokens at once or within a short time frame can sink the price action of that token in the short term.</p>

<p>When it comes to inflation, cryptocurrency is either <strong>inflationary</strong> or <strong>deflationary</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="inflactionary-tokens">INFLACTIONARY TOKENS</h4>

<p>If a crypto has too much inflation, it can reduce the value of the coins or tokens already in circulation over time.</p>

<p>Unless the inflation schedule is extremly aggressive, it will have little to no effect on the short-term price potential of a cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>Proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies often have some degree of inflation to incentivize validators and delegators on their networks.</p>

<p>This normally ranges anywhere between 5-15%.</p>

<p>Crypto like Polkadot adjust their inflation based on staking participation to maintime the security of the network.</p>

<p>Many DeFi tokens also use inflation to reward liquidity providers and yield farmers on their respective protocols.</p>

<p>DeFi tokens often have incredibly aggressive inflation schedules to keep their annual percentage yields.</p>

<h4 id="deflactionary-tokens">DEFLACTIONARY TOKENS</h4>

<p>If the crypto is defiationary the reduction in supply increases the value of that crypto over time.</p>

<p>While this may also not have a big influence in the short term, this deflation is part of why cryptocurrencies like BTC are so valuable.</p>

<p>Although new BTC are mined every 10 mins, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 milllion and the amount of new BTC being created per block is cut in half roughly every 4 years.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is deflationary because of <strong>accidential loss</strong>.</p>

<p>Everytime some someone forgets their password, it reduces the supply of crypto in circulation.</p>

<p><strong>This means that crypto with a maximum supply like BTC are deflationary in practice.</strong></p>

<p>Conversely, some cryptocurrencies intentionally reduce their supply by burning coins or tokens.</p>

<p>For example, the latest upgrade to Ethereum, will burn part of the ETH used to pay for network fees.</p>

<p>Even though Ethereum is tecnically inflationary, if enough people are using this network, the fee burns will be more than the inflation, which would turn ETH into a deflationary asset.</p>

<p>Some belive that this change could propel the price of ETH well past 20k dollars.</p>

<p>Unfortunately to the people staking their ETH on Ethereum 2.0, they probably won’t be able to realize those gains even when they come.</p>

<h2 id="staking-and-utility">STAKING AND UTILITY</h2>

<p>When you stake a cryptocurrency as a validator or a delegator, those coins or tokens are usually locked up for some period of time.</p>

<p>In the case  of Ethereum 2.0 any ETH being stake will not be unlocked until 2022.</p>

<p>At the earliest this means, that if the price of ETH starts to skyrocket, all the ETH being staked is not going to be making it onto any exchanges.</p>

<p>This conveniently restricts the actual circulating supply of ETH, which could enhance the positive price action.</p>

<p>This effect is much bigger for other proof-of-stake crypto like Polkadot, where more than 60% of DOT’s supply is being staked. 28 day unlock period.</p>

<p>Cardano have no lock up periods for staked coins. This means that all of that staked ADA could move onto exchanges at a moment’s notice and push a parabolic move back down as people take profits.</p>

<p>Besides the restrictive effects on supply staking is also a common utility for many coins and tokens.</p>

<p><strong>Utility is also referred to as a use case and includes basically anything that drives demand for a cryptocurrency coin or token.</strong></p>

<p><strong>BTC’s primary utility is as a store of value, like gold.</strong></p>

<p>The difference is that, BTC is accessible to bascally anyone with an internet connection, whereas gold requires a bit more infrastructure to get your hands on and store.</p>

<p>Given how poorly fiat currencies hold their value these days, there is a lot of demand for an easily accessible store of value like Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Hence that’s why it is the most valuable cryptocurrency on the market.</p>

<p><strong>Ethereum’s primary utility is to pay fees to use the decentralized applications built on it and move any ERC20 tokens around.</strong></p>

<p>There are hundres of Dapps and thousands of EREC20 tokens, which means a lot of demand for ETH to pay gas fees.</p>

<p>Hence, why it is the second most valuable cryptocurrency on the market.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Cryptocurrency/tokenomics/8.png" />
</center>

<p>Market caps of many DeFi tokens like ARVE are almost one-to-one with the total value locked on their protocols.</p>

<p>This makes it easy to spot DeFi crypto that are undervaluated or overvaluated.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">CONCLUSIONS</h2>

<p>While crypto tokens may be more profitable investments, they are also riskier to hold because of the regulatory risks they face.</p>

<p>Moreover, token profits are often short-lived, as many cryptocurrency projects with tokens aren’t built to last for more than a few years.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency coins often support larger ecosystems, which include Dapps, crypto tokens, that gives coins a longer shelf life and results in a more gradual increase in value as their ecosystem grow.</p>

<p>This growth in value isn’t always obvious, if you’re working off of te price alone.</p>

<p>Small circulating supplies can also threaten that value in near or distant future, if any of there idle coins or tokens start to move onto the market.</p>

<p>Usually its worth to value crypto based on their fully diluted market caps. This makes it easy to spot, when a cryto is overvaluated or undervaluated, regardless of its price tag.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu was created in August 2020, by a pseudonymous developer named Ryoshi.</p>

<p>Although Shiba Inu is branded as the “<em>Dogecoin Killer</em>”, Ryoshi explained in his first Medium post, that the project is essentially an experiment in community governance and decentralization.</p>

<p>Ryoshi came up with the idea for Shiba Inu with an anonymous friend, who he’d met at the Ethereum Devcon conference in Japan in 2019.</p>

<p>This anonymous friend is the one, who created the SHIB token smart contract on Ethereum, and also provided 10 ETH as liquidity for an ETH ship trading pair on the Uniswap decentralized exchange.</p>

<p>According to Ryoshi, this anonymous friend is a “<em>successful businessman</em>”, so 10 ETH is nothing for him.</p>

<h2 id="ryoshis-posts-on-medium-and-first-woof-paper">RYOSHI’S POSTS ON MEDIUM AND FIRST WOOF PAPER</h2>

<p>After the initial hype died down, Shiba Inu went into hibernation until February this year, when Ryoshi posted another article on Medium.</p>

<p>In it he explained, that Shiba Inu’s return is because, with the resurgence of DOGE, SHIB has caught fire, and is threatening to turn over the entire market.</p>

<p>The final sentence in the post also stuck out for me, and it reads:</p>

<p><strong>I don’t like centralized exchanges. Often times they destroy community projects by price suppressions. I do not endorse any, and only encourage you to use Uniswap and DEX.</strong></p>

<p>Shiba Inu’s first news mention came in mid-March, and it was about a 300 price pump caused by Elon Musk’s tweet, that he would be getting a shiba inu dog.</p>

<p>About one month later, the Shiba Inu community released the first version of their white paper, which is of course called the Woof Paper.</p>

<p>SHIB’s similarities to DOGE caused it, and other dog themed tokens to dominate the headlines in May, especially when Vitalik announced his massive SHIB burn and donation.</p>

<h2 id="shiba-ecosystem">SHIBA ECOSYSTEM</h2>

<p>As Shiba Inu’s own website explains:</p>

<p><strong>SHIB is no longer just a meme token, it is a part of a larger ecosystem being built by the shiba inu community.</strong></p>

<p>Most of this ecosystem centers around DeFi, specifically the <strong>Shibaswap decentralized exchange</strong>, whose code is currently being audited by Certig.</p>

<p>Like some other DEXs, Shibaswap’s launch will begin with a two-week liquidity event, which will incentivize liquidity providers to move their LP tokens from Uniswap and Sushiswap to Shibaswap.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/shiba/shibaswap.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="dexes-and-liquidity-providing">DEXES AND LIQUIDITY PROVIDING</h2>

<p>Liquidity Provider Tokens or LP tokens are given to users, who give two cryptocurrencies to a decentralized exchange to earn fees for that trading pair.</p>

<p>For example, if you provide ETH and USDC liquidity to the ETH-USDC Uniswap pool, you will receive an equivalent amount of LP tokens.</p>

<p>These LP tokens represent the ETC and USDC you locked in the Uniswap pool.</p>

<p>Each LP token type is fungible i.e, identical, and can easily be traded with other users 
by incentivizing Sniswap and Sushiswap LPs to move their LP tokens to Shibaswap.</p>

<p>It becomes possible to do something called a <strong>Vampire Attack</strong>, wherein all the liquidity on a DEX is swapped to another.</p>

<p>In plain English, it makes it possible to take most of the cryptocurrency trading pair value from one DEX and move it to another DEX.</p>

<p>This is exactly what the Shiba Inu community is looking to do, and they’re hoping to lure dog-minded LPs to their decks with bones, literally.</p>

</center>

<h2 id="bone-token">BONE TOKEN</h2>

<p>BONE is an ERC20 token on Ethereum and a part of Shiba Inu’s upcoming ecosystem.</p>

<p>BONE is not yet in circulation.</p>

<p>The BONE you’ll find on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko is related to a different dog project.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu’s BONE will be given as reward to stakers and liquidity providers on the Shibaswap DEX, and it will also give governance rights to its holders, where 1 BONE equals 1 vote.</p>

<p>BONE can also be staked to earn more BONE and providing liquidity for the BONE-ETH pair, will allow BONE ease LPs to earn 0.1% of all DAI and USDT swap transactions.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/shiba/bone1.png" />
</center>

<p>An interesting setup, to say the least.</p>

<p>BONE will have a maximum supply of 250 million, and a predetermined amount of BONE will be generated per Ethereum block, until it reaches its maximum supply.</p>

<p>In a few years this emission schedule can be seen in the image here.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting, that it’s extremely aggressive.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/shiba/bone2.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="multi-signature-wallets">MULTI SIGNATURE WALLETS</h2>

<p>During Shibaswap’s two-week liquidity event to incentivize LPs to migrate their LP tokens from other DEXs, a small portion of the BONE per block will be allocated to a multi-signature development wallet, to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project.</p>

<h2 id="government-stay-away">GOVERNMENT STAY AWAY</h2>

<p>On that note, it’s worth pointing out, that the first version of Shiba Inu’s Woof Paper notes, that centralized exchanges will not be allowed to earn any BONE rewards from Shibaswap, whereas the second version specifies, that “<em>unaffiliated centralized exchanges will be barred from earning BONE rewards</em>”.</p>

<p>This is one of the few changes between the two Woof Papers with most relating to the BONE rewards earned by stakers and LPs, which deal in not just BONE and SHIB but another token called LEASH.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/shiba/grr.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="leash">LEASH</h2>

<p>LEASH is another ERC20 token on Ethereum, and also part of Shiba Inu’s upcoming ecosystem.</p>

<p>LEASH is in circulation as of April, and it was initially designed to “<em>Tame DOGE by rebasing to 1000x the price of DOGE at 630 UTC every day.</em>”.</p>

<p><strong>Now as a simple example, if DOGE is worth 1 cent at that time LEASH will rebase to 10 dollars.</strong></p>

<p>Ryoshi’s reasoning behind LEASH is to “<em>offer a synth to hedge the price of DOGE”</em>.</p>

<p>Anyways, LEASH is no longer a rebase token.</p>

<p>It has a maximum supply just north of 107 000 LEASH, all of which is in circulation.</p>

<p>This low supply is why LEASH has such a high dollar value.</p>

<p>In case you didn’t know, while LEASH has no use case per se, it can be staked to earn BONE and those, who provide liquidity for the LEASH-ETH pair will earn 0.1% of all wrapped BTC and USDC swap transactions.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/shiba/leash.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="shib">SHIB</h2>

<p>This brings us to our third and last token, and that’s SHIB.</p>

<p>SHIB is an ERC20 token on Ethereum, and the flagship token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem.</p>

<p>SHIB had an initial supply of one quadrillion.</p>

<p>50% of this supply went to the initial ETH-SHIB pool on Uniswap, and the remainder was sent to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin’s cold wallet address by Shiba Inu’s founder.</p>

<h2 id="vitalik-and-india-charity">VITALIK AND INDIA CHARITY</h2>

<p>The reason why Ryoshi did this is not entirely clear, but it was likely for marketing purposes.</p>

<p>Since many other cryptocurrency projects have tried running campaigns saying Vitalik supports their project after sending their tokens to Vitalik’s wallet address without his knowledge.</p>

<p>Whether Vitalik had advanced knowledge of this token transfer in particular is something I’ll dig into later.</p>

<p>According to Vitalik, he noticed earlier this year that he had billions of dollars of a token called SHIB in his cold wallet address.</p>

<p>At the time Vitalik was a billionaire from his ETH holdings alone.</p>

<p>So he figured that donating these dog tokens would be the best course of action.</p>

<p>There’s just one problem, and that’s that Vitalik was stuck overseas, because of the pandemic, and part of his cold wallet address was at his parents home in Canada.</p>

<p>After assembling the full seed phrase, Vitalik accessed his cold wallet, and proceeded to burn 80% of the SHIB tokens he’d been given.</p>

<p>He then donated the remaining 20% to various organizations and causes, notably the India Coveted Relief Fund and an institute, which specializes in longevity research.</p>

<p>There are apparently other organizations, which have yet to announce, that they’ve received SHIB tokens from Vitalik as a donation.</p>

<p>Now, this is important to note, because it’s been falsely reported, that Vitalik burned 90% of his SHIB, and donated the rest to just the India Covert Relief Fund.</p>

<p>In any case, the total value of the SHIB Vitalik burned was over 6 billion dollars at the time.</p>

<p>It’s unlikely that this money could have been cashed out, because of market depth, but that’s neither here nor there.</p>

<center>

</center>

<h2 id="shib-token">SHIB TOKEN</h2>

<p>As with LEASH, SHIB does not have a specific use case, however SHIB can be staked to earn a boat load of BONE in addition to 0.1% of all ETH swap transaction fees on Shibaswap, which is likely to be lucrative.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/shiba/shib.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="shib-price-prediction">SHIB PRICE PREDICTION</h2>

<p>SHIB was worth next to nothing, until the end of February, when its price started to spike alongside DOGE.</p>

<p>SHIB continued rising into March and April, and peaked in mid-May at 3000 of a cent, after its binance listing announcement.</p>

<p>The massive crash that came shortly afterwards was caused by a combination of cell pressure from SHIB donation recipients, coupled with the general crash of the crypto market.</p>

<p>Even though SHIB has fallen from grace, it still somehow has a market cap of over 3.3 billion dollars and this brings a very important point.</p>

<p><strong>Will never reach a cent much less a dollar, and that’s because its supply is so massive.</strong></p>

<p>This is something that the average crypto investor doesn’t seem to understand.</p>

<p>Raching a dollar would give SHIB a market cap of nearly 400 billion dollars, which would make it larger than Ethereum. That’s not going to happen.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/shiba/shib-chart.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="peak-in-future-bc-of-unexperienced-investors">PEAK IN FUTURE BC OF UNEXPERIENCED INVESTORS</h2>

<p>That said, SHIB still seems to have some potential.</p>

<p>Given that it’s moments away from releasing the Shibaswap DEX, which will drive demand, that doesn’t depend on Dogecoin.</p>

<p>We could potentially see SHIB retest its previous all-time high, especially if the rest of the crypto market is moving in the same direction.</p>

<p>SHIB’s Coinbase listing will certainly help, as retail traders pile in under the pretense, that they’ll get rich, if it goes to a dollar, which again, isn’t going to happen.</p>

<h2 id="not-listed-on-coinbase">NOT LISTED ON COINBASE</h2>

<p>On that note, you might be wondering, why SHIB isn’t trading on Coinbase already.</p>

<p>Well, apparently, this is due to technical issues on Coinbase’s side, which also delayed the listing of Solana’s SOL by over a month.</p>

<p>The strange thing is that, SHIB isn’t on its own blockchain.</p>

<p>It’s an ERC20 token.</p>

<p>Now, ERC20 tokens are extremely easy to list on an exchange, so this may mean, that there are other reasons for SHIB’s Coinbase listing delay, and one of these might relate to the Shibaswap DEX.</p>

<p>Coinbase tends to list cryptocurrencies that are complete, and Shiba Inu won’t be complete until the Shibaswap DEX launches.</p>

<p>Rather than backtrack on their listing announcement, Coinbase might be claiming technical issues to buy time, so as not to set a bad precedent for future token listings.</p>

<h2 id="shiba-swap-and-uniswap-v3">SHIBA SWAP AND UNISWAP V3</h2>

<p>So when could we see the Shibaswap?</p>

<p>DEX members of the Shiba Inu community have already released DEX demos on Youtube, so we know it’s not just smoke and mirrors.</p>

<p>Shibaswap has actually been in the works for quite some time, and I suspect that the launch was delayed after the release of Uniswap V3.</p>

<p>This is because LP tokens on Uniswap V3 are non-fungible.</p>

<p>They’re literally like NFTs, and this means that other DEXs can’t pull off the sort of Vampire Attack.</p>

<p>Shibaswap will be released once Certik completes its audit of the code.</p>

<p>While there does not appear to be a set date for this, I couldn’t help but notice, that the latest Woof Paper shows BONE’s emission schedule beginning on July the 1st this year.</p>

<h2 id="new-tokens---dao-and-treat">NEW TOKENS - DAO AND TREAT</h2>

<p>As with the first Woof Paper, the second version also reiterates the fact, that the official road map for Shiba Inu is <em>top secret</em>.</p>

<p>Though it does offer a few hints as to what comes next after Shibaswap.</p>

<p>The first thing we will see after Shibaswap launches, is the introduction of a 4th token called TREAT, whose tokenomics have yet to be detailed.</p>

<p>All we know is that, it will be a <em>very special token</em>.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/shiba/treat.png" />
</center>

<p>Later this year, we will see the formation of the “<em>DOGGY DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, that will govern the Shiba Inu ecosystem</em>”.</p>

<p>No fixed date has yet been provided for the DAO.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/shiba/dao.png" />
</center>

<h2 id="shibarium---ethereum-token-andstable-coin-she">SHIBARIUM - ETHEREUM TOKEN ANDSTABLE COIN SHE</h2>

<p>Shiba Inu’s longer-term roadmap was detailed by Ryoshi in his most recent Medium post, at the end of May, and it contains some pretty ambitious goals.</p>

<p>The first is the creation of a layer 2 blockchain for Ethereum called <strong>Shibarium</strong>, which will have BONE as its native token.</p>

<p>Ryoshi notes, that he’s reached out to a team, which will develop this blockchain pro bono and i suspect it might be Polygon.</p>

<p>Given Ryoshi’s description of Shibarium, the second goal depends on the first, and that’s a creation of a stable coin called SHE, that’s pegged to 1 cent.</p>

<p>With SHE and Shibarium, Ryoshi hopes that Shiba Inu will finally become the “Dogecoin Killer” it was bred to be.</p>

<p>Did I mention, that it will do DeFi as well, or should i say Sheepfire.</p>

<h2 id="shibacons">SHIBACONS</h2>

<p>Anyways, the final goal detailed by Ryoshi involves the creation of ShibaCon, an annual crypto conference for Shiba Inu enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Tentative dates and locations have already been set for the first 3 ShibaCon conferences.</p>

<h2 id="whos-ryoshi">WHO’S RYOSHI?</h2>

<p>Who the hell is Ryoshi?</p>

<p>Ryoshi’s identity has yet to be revealed, however, what we do know about him suggests that this whole Shiba Inu saga didn’t happen by accident.</p>

<p>Ryoshi’s first Medium post finishes with a rare photo of Vitalik Butarian in Japan, presumably during DevCon in 2019</p>

<p>The man in the brown jacket is apparently Ryoshi himself.</p>

<p>If this is true, then Vitalik may be the anonymous friend, Ryoshi credits for creating the Shiba Inu smart contract, and providing the initial ETH liquidity for SHIB on Uniswap.</p>

<p>More importantly, it’s not just Vitalik, who’s in that photo.</p>

<p>Ethereum foundation director Aya Miyaguchi is also seen walking with the group, which presumably contains individuals of similar stature.</p>

<p>Regardless of who Ryoshi is, it’s clear, that he has close connections to some very important people in crypto, and this means, that he’s not just some anonymous developer who came out of nowhere.</p>

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/shiba/vitalik2.jpg" />
</center>

<h2 id="ryoshi-role">RYOSHI ROLE</h2>

<p>Ryoshi is probably not some sort of malicious actor looking to get rich quick.</p>

<p>Quite the contrary.</p>

<p>In fact, Ryoshi apparently has 0 stake in SHIB, and only bought a bit at the beginning on Uniswap, like everyone, else before selling shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>This is easily verified by checking SHIB’s distribution on EtherScan, which is pretty equitable for a meme token.</p>

<p>What’s more is that, even though Ryoshi put this project into motion he doesn’t seem to play a very important role at all.</p>

<p>Almost everything about Shiba Inu has been made by its community so much, so that Shiba Inu’s own social media accounts have been hijacked on multiple occasions by bad actors, looking to undermine the project Dogecoin sympathizes.</p>

<p>Perhaps as many questions, as there still are around Shiba Inu, there’s no doubt, that this is a dog crypto unlike any other, and it may in fact be the Dogecoin Killer.</p>

<h2 id="shiba-and-doge">SHIBA AND DOGE</h2>

<p>So is Shiba Inu is a coin?</p>

<p>It definitely doesn’t fall into the same category as most other meme coins.</p>

<p>Shiba Inu’s origin story is eerily similar to Dogecoins.</p>

<p>Both began as a joke, and were it not for Elon Musk’s tweets, they would both be dead altcoins.</p>

<p>Where Shiba Inu and Dogecoin differ, is the connections they have to the crypto community.</p>

<p>DOGE is really just a meme and nothing more.</p>

<p>All the development and growth seems to be coming from a handful of fanboys, who have probably lost touch with reality by now.</p>

<p>By contrast, SHIB is close to becoming a big player in Ethereum’s ecosystem by overcoming the shortcomings of Dogecoin as community driven as Shiba Inu is.</p>

<h2 id="shiba-and-vitalik">SHIBA AND VITALIK</h2>

<p>There definitely seemed to be some seriously prolific people behind the project, it wouldn’t be surprising at all, if Ryoshi is in fact someone well-known and liked by the Ethereum foundation.</p>

<p>You don’t just magically find yourself hanging out with Vitalik.</p>

<p>Vitalik also fits the profile of a “<em>successful businessman</em>”, who has no shortage of ETH, and also has a history of handing out cryptocurrency to projects and causes he believes in.</p>

<p>It’s likely that Vitalik knew about his SHIB allocation in advance, but like Ryoshi, Vitalik probably didn’t think Shiba Inu would become a billion dollar enterprise.</p>

<p>The dollar amount of SHIB he donated, corresponds to the dollar amount, he held in other cryptocurrencies at the time.</p>

<p>Not familiar with Canadian tax law, but probably gifts are not taxed, and that SHIB donation is probably tax deductible.</p>

<p>If that’s correct, this would make it possible for Vitalik to sell over a billion dollars in cryptocurrency tax-free this year, if he wanted to.</p>

<p>If that’s the case, he deserves it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">CONCLUSIONS</h2>

<p>If Shiba Inu shows anything, it’s that, it really doesn’t take that much to make money in cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>The question is, how you use that money to make something meaningful, that will last and benefit everyone involved, not just the people who got in early.</p>

<p>This idea lies at the heart of Shiba Inu, and even though the project isn’t appealing enough, that is something to respect.</p>
