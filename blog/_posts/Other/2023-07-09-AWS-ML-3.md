## AWS Machine Learning Specialty 3/3

### Amazon ML Evaluation Metrics
- **Area Under the Curve (AUC)**
  - Measures model's ability to predict higher scores for positive examples.
  - Independent of score cut-off, providing insight into prediction accuracy without threshold selection.
- **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve**
  - Graphical plot showing diagnostic ability as the discrimination threshold varies.

### Evaluate with Scatter Plot
- Represent relationships between variables, not model evaluation.
  
### Evaluate with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- BAd for binary classification; used for regression models.

### Credit Risk Scenario
  - High accuracy might mislead if not balanced with true positives and false positives.
  - AUC of 0.9, even with lower accuracy, is considered better for identifying risky loans.

### Amazon SageMaker AutoPilot
  - Simplifies ML model training by handling feature engineering, model training, and selection.
  - Requires only the upload of a training dataset to S3.

### k-NN Models
  - Use Euclidean distance to measure similarity between target data and a specific class.

### AWS Data Pipeline
  - Reliably processes and moves data between AWS compute/storage services and on-premises sources.
  - Transfers results efficiently to services like Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon EMR.

### SageMaker Training Job
  - Includes training data S3 URL, ML compute instance configuration, output S3 bucket URL, and training code ECR path.

### AWS DMS Connection
  - Can't directly set up connections between Amazon RDS SQL Server or Amazon DynamoDB and SageMaker.

### Buffering in Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
  - Buffers incoming streaming data based on size or time before delivering to destinations.
  - Buffer size ranges from 1MB to 128MB for Amazon S3 and 1MB to 100MB for Amazon Elasticsearch Service.
  - Dynamically adjusts buffer size to catch up if data delivery to the destination falls behind data writing.

### Evaluation Metrics Formulas
- **Recall** TP / (TP + FN)
- **False Negative Rate** FN / (FN + TP)
- **Cost Function** (3 * FN) + FP

### Transfer Learning
- Network initialized with pre-trained weights.
- Top fully connected layer initialized with random weights.
- Fine-tuning of the whole network with new data.
- Suitable for training with smaller datasets.

### Imputing Missing Values
- Commonly involves replacing missing values with mean or median.
- Understanding data is crucial before choosing a replacement strategy.
- Supervised learning for approximating missing values often yields better results.

### Amazon SageMaker Data Formats
- Protobuf recordIO format recommended for training.
- Pipe mode streams data directly from Amazon S3, providing faster start times and better throughput.
- Pipe mode doesn't support Apache Parquet; File mode is slower and default but less efficient.

### Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)
- Oversampling approach for the minority class, creating synthetic examples.
- Involves introducing synthetic examples along line segments of minority class nearest neighbors.
- Preferable for dealing with imbalanced datasets, such as fraudulent cases.

### Apache Spark on Amazon EMR
- Best place for running Apache Spark.
- Allows easy creation of managed Spark clusters.
- Includes libraries for machine learning (MLlib), stream processing (Spark Streaming), and graph processing (GraphX).
- Collaborative filtering leverages other users' experiences.

### Apache HBase and Machine Learning
- Apache HBase is a non-relational distributed database, not suitable for machine learning tasks.
- Content-based filtering is more suited for predicting based on product attributes.

### AWS Panorama for Computer Vision
- AWS Panorama allows bringing computer vision to on-premises cameras.
- Enables predictions locally with high accuracy and low latency.
- Suitable for leveraging existing IP cameras without AI capabilities.

### Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TfIdf)
- Algorithm to convert text data into a numerical representation.
- Utilizes Term Frequency (word frequency in a sentence) and Inverse Document Frequency (word frequency in the whole corpus).
- Scikit-learn CountVectorizer Class is incorrect; it provides a simple word count.

### Amazon S3 Storage Classes
- S3 Standard-IA designed for long-lived, infrequently accessed data.
- Retrieval fee applicable; suitable for infrequent access.
- Incurring costs using an EC2 instance is incorrect; Glacier Deep Archive provides delayed access; 30-day wait before transitioning to Standard-IA.

### AWS Step Functions
- Serverless function orchestrator for sequencing AWS Lambda functions and multiple services.
- Visual interface for creating and running checkpointed and event-driven workflows.
- Efficient orchestration of multiple ETL jobs possible.

### Amazon SageMaker Object2Vec
- General-purpose neural embedding algorithm.
- Highly customizable; learns low-dimensional dense embeddings.
- Not suitable for extracting embeddings representing compliance in a claim.

### SVM with Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel
- Variation of SVM for separating non-linear data.
- Efficiently maps data to a higher dimension.
- Suitable for separating randomly distributed data in a 2-D space.




Happy learning! :)
