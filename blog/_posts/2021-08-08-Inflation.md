##### DEFLATION IN JAPAN

The risk of inflation in March of last year was worrying.

The excess monetary stimulus, that was being thrown at the markets, and the impact that this would have, once the lockdowns eased was concerning.

Some said that inflation concerns were misguided, that deflation was the more likely scenario.

That's not something to blame.

This was the main narrative, that was coming from the FED.

They were really concerned about a Japanese-style deflationary and stagnating economy, hence the reason that they flooded the system with money.

##### PRINTING MONEY AND PLANS TO KEEP THE INFLATION AT 2%

However, that was a year ago, and things have progressed at a lightning pace.

Money printing continued through the rest of the year, as countries tried to stave off incoming second and third waves.

However, as vaccines started to roll out, and lockdowns were slowly being lifted, things began to change.

The FED was hoping to keep the market tethered to its inflation average target of below 2%.

Paul and CO said, that they didn't have any fears of inflation, and as such, would not be tightening monetary policy anytime soon.

##### COMMODITIES AND PRICE RISES

This was despite some of the warning signs. that were coming through the data commodity.

Prices were starting to surge across the board.

For example, this tweet from Dan Held.

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

Back in April those were the price increases, that we were seeing for some of these commodities.

As we know, commodities are used as raw materials for other goods and services.
 
It was inevitable, that we would start to see these price increases work their way through the rest of the economy.

Fuel prices have been on the rise since the beginning of the year, and house prices have been skyrocketing a combination of demand and lumber shortages.

So inflation was already beginning to rear its ugly head, and there were many market participants, who were beginning to ring the alarm bells.

##### THE "SURPRISING" OUTCOME - INFLATION

Then came the April CPI numbers, which were released 2 weeks ago.

They showed, that consumer prices had increased by 4.2% in the 12 months from April 2020.

That's a full 2.2% above the FED target and even higher, than some economists were predicting.

It was also the highest CPI print since 2009.

Needless to say, it took the market by surprise, and led to a jump in long-term bond yields, and a fall in stock and crypto prices.

##### PPI - PRODUCER PRICE INFLATION

Things didn't get that much better, when a day later the US PPI numbers came in.

**Producer Price Inflation is a measure of the prices, that companies pay for the inputs of the goods, that they use in their production.**

These were up over 6.2% in April, and it was the largest increase in the PPI measure, since they started tracking it back in 2010.

There was also a 0.6% increase in the PPI in just one month from March.

So irrespective of how you slice or dice it, the inflation numbers were not looking good, and I'm sure, that the folks over at the FED were also starting to feel the heat.

**What did they expect, when they printed 25% of all the money ever in existence in a single year?**

##### WHY INFLATION IS DEADLY

Anyways, there are a number of reasons, as to why inflation is so deadly, and I'm not even talking about the hyperinflation, that you see.

**In failed states inflation is the general increase in the price of goods and services.**

In a country it's a broad measure of how much the cost of living has increased over time.

An increase in prices is not terrible, as long as it's measured and in line with expectations, as well as increasing incomes.

However, when it is running above expectations, then it can lead to further inflation, as people increase their prices to match their expectations.

Persistent and high inflation is also detrimental to savers, as it means that the dollars, that they hold in their bank account are worth less today, than they were a year ago.

##### INFLATION AND INVESTORS

And it's not just individuals, that suffer the impact of higher inflation.

Think about all those institutional investors, that have to try and get an attractive real rate of return on their funds.

With a higher rate of inflation their dollar-denominated returns are less.

Or how about corporates?

When a corporate keeps cash on its balance sheet in order to fund its treasury management activities, that cash is depreciating at the rate of inflation.

This is a destruction of shareholder value, and means, that these companies will have fewer funds to invest in operations in the future.

In fact, it could be worse for corporate balance sheets than consumers.

##### CPI CONSUMPTION

Now, as I mentioned earlier, PPI, which is a production measure, was running hotter than CPI consumption.

The cost of inputs for companies is running higher, which means, that dollars saved on balance sheets, are worth that much less.

##### IMPACT ON THE US DOLLAR

But that's not even the worst part about inflation.

You have to consider the impact, that it has on the US dollar.

More broadly, the US dollar is the world's reserve currency, which means, that a great deal of it is held offshore.

Fun fact, it's estimated, that between 40-70% of all US dollar bank notes in circulation, are held outside of US borders.

Then of course, you have all those foreign central banks, that don't only hold US dollars, but also dollar denominated debt.

The more value that the dollar loses each year, the more likely these central banks and foreign holders are to diversify their currency risk.

Of course, any selling by offshore holders devalues the US dollar relative to other currencies.

Take a look at this chart here.

It shows the US dollar index over the past month.

As you can see, it's been trending down recently, and is near the lowest levels, that we've seen this year.

When the US dollar devalues relative to other currencies, it also makes the cost of imports that much more expensive, which of course adds to the inflation equation.

The point is that inflation is toxic and should be avoided.

It's also one of those things, that are hard to reign back in again.

##### CPI INFLATION - CPI BASKET

Once the genie is out of the bottle, and there is a strong case to be made, that the CPI inflation itself is vastly underestimating the true inflation.

**The main point of contention here comes down to the basket of goods and services used to measure the CPI.**

Basically the CPI measure is under counting inflation, because of the fact that the bureau of labor statistics adjusts the composition of the goods and services in that basket between two time periods.

Instead of looking at the price of the same goods and services between the two periods, it accounts for substitution and quality changes.

It assumes that consumers adjust behavior, and hence it means, that the composition of the basket has to change.

The main point to take away from this is that, they are not really comparing apples with apples, and it's not only that you should consider.

##### WHAT DID THEY NOT INCLUDE IN THEIR REPORTS - PANDEMIC OUTCOME

**The fact that the basket used to determine this CPI does not include assets such as investment assets.**

**It does not include housing prices, even though these play a large part in the cost of living conundrum.**

I, of course, don't need to tell you about how quickly the cost of housing has been going up recently.

Then you have to consider, how much consumption patterns have changed in the wake of the pandemic.

Think about what was purchased, and what was not.

In the wake of the lockdowns travel and leisure completely collapsed.

The only items, that people spent more on, were groceries and booze, both of which make sense.

In the words of IMF economist Marshall Reinstorf "*Spending patterns changed abruptly, and the CPI weight suddenly became obsolete."*

Apart from this, most shopping went online, where the price fluctuation can be a lot more rapid and volatile.

##### INCORRECT DATA

Not only that, but because of this, shift data collection of the prices of goods services in the basket was hard to do.

Researchers could not visit physical stores in order to gather that price data.

So this means that the cost of living over the past year has been much higher, than we're being led to believe based on the CPI data.

One more interesting chart, that you can look at, is this one by economist Alberto Cavall, which shows a different covert basket, which is running considerably hotter than the actual CPI basket.

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

Of course, I don't think we need a CPI measure to tell us, how much prices have gone up over the past year, and what's even more disconcerting about all of this is the fact, that most employers determine salary increases based on these official figures.

##### HOW TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM INFLATION? - INVEST IN THINGS OF LIMITED SUPPLY

So, it's quite clear, that inflation is a massive problem, and one that we could be under counting this then begs a very important question.

How do you protect yourself from this upcoming inflation?

The best hedges against inflation are those, that have a limited supply.

Those, that cannot easily be devalued by increasing the amount of supply in circulation.

Traditionally, these have been hard assets, like gold, which are perceived to have a limited supply, as well as fundamental use cases, as in jewellery, etc.

##### GOLD SHOULD BE THE SALTVATION. BUT THERE WAS NO HEDGE..?

However, if we take a look at the performance of gold over the past year, it's been relatively meager.

Now, you would have thought, that the world's premier reserve asset would have been breaking new all-time highs this year.

This has not been the case, but there is another inflation hedge, that has been doing just that, and that is of course Bitcoin.

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

##### BITCOIN - LIMITED SUPPLY

The reason that Bitcoin is seen as such an effective inflation hedge, is because of the fact, that it has a hard defined limit of 21 million.

There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin mined.

Fun fact, there are currently 51 million dollar millionaires in the world, so if each of them wanted some Bitcoin, there is not enough to go around for each to even have half a Bitcoin.

This is not even counting the fact, that at least 20% of Bitcoin has been lost forever.

##### DECREASING EMISSION SCHEDULE

Another supply factor, that you have to consider is the fact, that Bitcoin has a decreasing emission schedule.

Its inflation rate keeps on falling and approaches 0 over time.

Now, of course there are many more qualities, that make Bitcoin more favorable to gold as an asset to store wealth.

And it's not just me, that is saying this.

The Bitcoin inflation hedge trade has been taken on by numerous institutional investors.

##### INVESTORS THAT CONVERTED TO BITCOIN CULT

For example, one of the most prolific global macro investors is Paul Tudor Jones, and last year he wrote this paper on the great monetary inflation quite simply.

It talked about the impact, that money printing would have on asset markets, and why he was investing in Bitcoin.

You also have the likes of Stanley Druckenmiller, one of the most well-known Forex traders in the world.

He was also raising the alarm bells around this incoming USD inflation, and the implications, this could have on the Bitcoin markets.

He even went a step further and claimed, that cryptocurrency like Bitcoin could one day replace the US dollar as a global reserve asset.

Or how about Bill Miller, the storied value investor behind the Leg Mason Opportunity fund?

He basically pointed out in a Q4 market update, that if inflation were to pick up, then corporates would be allocating a larger proportion of their balance sheet towards Bitcoin.

"*Trickle would turn into a torrent, and that trickle has already started*".

##### COMPANIES THAT INVESTED IN BTC

We know of a number of companies, that have been allocating a portion of their treasury positions towards Bitcoin.

These of course include the likes of Microstrategy, Square, Tesla, MeToo and Acre, to name but a few.

Now, these companies all allocated to Bitcoin, as they were worried about the impact, that the inflation would have on their long-term shareholder value, and as Bill Miller stated, this trickle is likely to become a Torrent.

That is because of the sheer number of companies, that are concerned about the impact of inflation.

Take a look at this chart.

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

It shows, the percentage increase in the average mentions of the word "*inflation*" by 26 S&P 500 companies in their earnings calls.

Clearly, the concern is on their mind, and this was even before we had those high CPI and PPI prints 2 weeks ago.

You can bet your bottom dollar, that these will be up yet again in the next round of earnings calls.

#### WHY BITCOIN FELL?

We know, that Bitcoin is seen as a premier inflation hedge.

This then begs a very important question.

Why did it fall the day of that CPI print?

Surely, it should have rallied.

There is a lot more going on here.

##### FED COMES IN AND INCREASES INTEREST RATES

When the CPI prints came in 2 weeks ago and took the markets by surprise, the main concern was not really the actual inflation itself, but what it meant for interest rates.

You see, the market is aware of the fact, that the FED has a set inflation target of 2% earlier this year.

The FED was giving guidance that it would not be loosening monetary policy this year.

In fact, the FED was hoping to keep the average inflation below the percent target until at least 2023.

Therefore, with such a high print above the inflation target, it means, that the FED has had its hand forced.

It will need to increase interest rates in order to rein back in that money and stop the economy from overheating. 

Of course, higher interest rates have large implications.

For nearly every asset class out there, including Bitcoin, we actually saw this more recently, when the secretary of the treasury caused an interest rate scare with her comments about monetary tightening.

##### CORRELATION BETWEEN FUND RATE AND BTC

Why does a higher FED's fund rate impact on Bitcoin?

This is because despite Bitcoin being a long-term hedge for inflation, it is still viewed as a risk-on asset.

These are assets, that are generally riskier, and which investors are happy to allocate their funds to in a low rates environment assets that are more risk-off, include bonds and cash.

These of course yield much more when rates go up.

I should also point out, that when rates go up, the discount rate used to calculate future cash flows goes up, which means a lower present stock value.

But that is neither here nor there.

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

##### BECAUSE ITS A RISKY ASSET - INVESTORS STICK TO SMTH SAFER

The point is that, in an environment with rising rates, risk on assets tend to underperform.

Given that Bitcoin is seen as one of the riskiest assets in the risky bucket, it will naturally also suffer from this.

There is statistical evidence.

Here you only need to take a look at the correlation between the price of equities and crypto.

Last year in 2020 we had the highest correlation between the two factors since data has been tracked.

Take a look at this report by the chaps over at Van Eck.

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

As you can see from this analysis, there was almost no correlation between them in the years prior, whereas last year it was statistically significant.

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

Here you can see another chart, that shows the correlation as a graph.

![image.png](attachment:image.png)

Over time it's a clear uptrend from mildly negative in 2017, to moderately positive this year.

##### NOT HEDGE FOR STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY

From all the available evidence, it appears that Bitcoin is not really a hedge for stock market volatility. 

It is placed in the same bucket, and will hence rise and fall.

##### CORRELATED WITH STOCKS - HENCE SENSITIVE TO INTEREST RATE

Bitcoin is correlated with stocks, and is hence sensitive to interest rate hikes.

However, inflation is much more pervasive, and unlike the FED's fund rate, it is hard as hell to control.

Moreover, Bitcoin is not a cash flow based asset like stocks.

It's an asset, that has completely different characteristics and use cases.

Its correlation to stocks is more of a short-term phenomenon, as these institutional investors adjust their portfolios.

It's unlikely to be a long-term trend, and as such, I happen to think, that Bitcoin will become less responsive to rate hike fears, just the way it was intended.

#### CONCLUSION

Last year in response to the pandemic governments seem to have thrown the baby out with the bath water, and that water is now flooding the streets leaving them awash with cash.

It's even more worrying now, than it was last year, and if the recent cpi prints and stock route is anything to go by the fear has become real.

No, it's not Venezuela or Zimbabwe levels of inflation, but it's alarming for many of the reasons that were highlighted earlier.

These inflationary concerns are having two contradictory effects on the markets in the short term.

They're causing panic because of the fears, that they could lead to a FED tapering.

The markets have become drunk on the free money, that has been raining down on them, and they are now worried, that the FED's founding may slow to a trickle.

These fears have also led to a sell-off in Bitcoin, but this is likely to only be temporary.

The inflation narrative is likely to be that much more pervasive and last for quite some time.

This is because it's a lot harder to rein it in without seriously damaging the economy.

In this climate, it will be hard for people companies and institutions to preserve their investments and purchasing power going forward.

Bitcoin really is the digital gold that they have been looking for.

Limited supply, decreasing inflation rate, easy to transport and store in the turbulent sea of rising prices, it really will be the lifeboat sent from above to rescue you from decreasing purchasing power.

All praise to Satoshi.
