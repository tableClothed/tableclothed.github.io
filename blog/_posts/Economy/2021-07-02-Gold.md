## GOLD VS FIAT- LIMITED SUPPLY

Why, in times of uncertainty, is gold often chosen as a place to stash wealth?

There are a number of factors, but it comes down to a few perceived characteristics:

Firstly, gold is seen as a hard asset that cannot be inflated away.

What does that mean?

**There's a certain supply out there in the world, and this supply cannot be impacted by the policies of a central bank or government.**

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Economy/gold/1.PNG'>
</center>

There is only one source of supply for new gold, and that is from the earth, either that be mines, that go deep underground or from alluvial mining.

They are the only sources of supply.

**When it comes to fiat currency on the other hand, it can easily be printed and inflated away.**

And, as everybody knows, inflation can be toxic.

For those people, who keep their funds in US dollars in a bank account, it's a silent tax, that you don't know about.

So gold buyers hold, as they don't want their investments to whittle away in value.

But apart from this, there are other more fundamental reasons that people hoard this stuff.

## GOLD INHERENT QUALITIES

Gold has value, because of its inherent qualities.

**It can be used to make jewelry and has existed for an eternity.**

**Fiat currency only has value, because the central bank says it does.**

It's backed by a promise from Jerome and his team over at the central bank tables.

## GOLD'S UNIVERSAL

Gold is also universal.

You can take it with you anywhere, and sell it wherever you want.

It can be seen as some form of global currency, that everyone is able to accept to some degree.

Sending funds around the world in fiat currency can be tricky, especially if you don't want people to know about it.

## FUNGIBILITY OF GOLD

And this of course brings us on to the point about fungibility of gold.

Essentially, one gold bar is always equal to one gold bar.

It's very hard to track gold.

However, if you send dollars through centralized bank accounts the powers, that be, can always restrict the movement, even if they can't they can easily see where your funds have gone. 

There's the obvious fact that gold is physical and sturdy.

Notes are regularly taken out of circulation and in some cases they even become obsolete.

A good example of this could of course be all european currency pre-Euro.

Can't imagine it's easy to convert French Francs into Euros these days.

The deadline for conversions was 2012.

</center>

## GOLD'S SKYROCKETING ON THE MARKET

All of these reasons are why gold has been steadily increasing in price over the year.

In fact, in August 2020 it reached an all-time high of over 2,100 on the spot market.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Economy/gold/3.PNG'>
</center>

The only problem here is the fact, that many of the assumptions that gold buyers hold of gold are flawed.

Not only that, but there are also some distinct qualities of gold that are disadvantageous.

## GOLD - LIMITED SUPPLY, BUT DOES IT REALLY?

Firstly, the notion of its limited supply.

The belief that just because gold has to be mined from the earth, it is naturally an asset, that must be held.

This is indeed true, however the operative word in that sentence is **Earth**.

Gold fans are basing their assumptions of supply on what is currently in the ground on this planet.

However gold can indeed be mined on asteroids, and the universe is infinite, which theoretically implies an infinite supply. 

**Asteroid mining could one day actually be a thing**. For example **Psyche 16*.

This is an asteroid that is nestled between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, and is made of solid metal.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Economy/gold/4.PNG'>
</center>

These metals include not only gold, but also platinum, nickel and iron.

By some estimates, Psyche 16 has enough mineral wealth on it to make everyone on the planet a billionaire.

93 billion, to be exact.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Economy/gold/5.PNG'>
</center>

## SUPPLY-DEMAND WITH MORE GOLD

Given the laws of supply and demand, this is unlikely to happen.

The moment that those metals start hitting the open market, it will make gold as worthless as the Venezuelan Bolivar.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Economy/gold/5.jpg'>
</center>

Not possible? 

NASA has been exploring the possibility of mining on asteroids for a number of years, and more recently they have approved a mission to visit Psyche 16.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Economy/gold/6.PNG'>
</center>

They will launch a spacecraft in 2022, which is hoped, will arrive at the asteroid by at least 2026.

Based on what they discover on this mission, it's not inconceivable that a larger mission won't be launched further down the line.

Yes, it could still be decades before any gold comes back to Earth and it is also not guaranteed to be feasible.

However, the mere fact that is a possibility should alarm gold buyers.

Would you feel safe parking a large proportion of your funds into a medium with that sort of long-term risk?

Would you feel confident storing family inheritance in a metal, that could one day become as abundant as steel?

## NOT SURE WHEN THE EXTRA GOLD HITS THE MARKET

All the time. deposits with millions of ounces of gold are being explored every day.

Point over in Siberia. A gold miner called Polyus said its untapped Sukoi Log deposits hold the world's biggest reserves - 40 million ounces.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Economy/gold/7.PNG'>
</center>

If this is going to be mined, it's a new supply that is going to hit the market.

If demand does not keep up with supply, then of course we're likely to see an impact on the price and this is just one gold deposit in one part of the world.

Who knows, how many untapped deposits we're likely to stumble upon.

These changes in the rate of gold supply mean, that it could be quite hard to form an investment thesis based on limited supply.

Yes, in theory gold supply is limited on Earth.

However, the rate at which that gold hits the market is not defined.

This rate of new supply impacts on the circulating supply, which of course, drives prices.

If there is a massive change in the amount of circulating gold on the market, then prices are likely to take a dip.

## MOVING GOLD FROM PLACE TO PLACE

As mentioned, gold is said to be physical and universally accepted.

It's believed that buyers can store their gold, hold value and, if needs, be hop on a plane and move to another country.

The only problem with that, is that **gold is not really that easy to transport.** 

If you're going to move large quantities of gold, you're going to have to use some security service like Brinks etc, to move the metal.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Economy/gold/8.jpg'>
</center>

Not only is this expensive, but you'll no doubt have to pay for insurance and storage along the way.

Or let's assume there's a situation, in which you have to leave the country in an emergency.

Let's say a collapse of the economy.

You would struggle to find a service to ship the gold.

Many may think, that they can just chuck it in a suitcase and jump on a plane.

Putting aside how risky it is actually holding so much of it on your person, you're likely to face a number of hurdles along the way.

Getting luggage like that past airport security will be quite difficult.

You should also note that many countries have mandatory reporting requirements for gold, when you attempt to cross their borders.

Many have pretty large import duties, which you will have to pay on the gold.

So yes, the very physical nature of gold means, that it's hard to move.

<center>

</center>

## SEIZING OF GOLD

But not only that, the physical nature of gold means, it's easy to seize.

Gold caesars are actually a thing, and are pretty easy to carry out.

Did you know that in 1933 Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued an executive order, that made it illegal to hold gold?

Yes, Executive Order 6102 made it a criminal offence to trade or hold gold.

All citizens, who did hold gold were told, it had to be brought to a bank in order to be exchanged for US dollars.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Economy/gold/10.jpg'>
</center>

You may be thinking, that this is the 21st century and government don't have the power to just seize property.

Well, before the year 2020 you didn't think governments had the power to shut down an entire country in order to respond to a pandemic.

Of course, the ends here are different, but the point is that governments have an immense amount of power over people, and it's not certain if they will always be the benevolent leaders, you think they are.

You may say to yourself, that you're going to hide that gold under your pillow, but the vast majority of private gold holdings are kept in secure vaults.

These vaults are well known to the powers, that be they could easily just go and help themselves to someone else's gold, if they see fit.

Nicholas Maduro also probably thought that Venezuela's gold was safe in some London vaults.

Then he found out that the UK government was withholding his access to those gold bars.

<center>

</center>

## ILLIQUIDITY OF GOLD

Beyond that though, there is another disadvantage that comes with gold's physicality, and that comes down to its liquidity.

Or, in this case, illiquidity.

As a hard physical asset, gold has to be transported to market in order to be sold.

This means that you have to assume that it can be moved.

While this would ordinarily be possible, things can go a bit haywire when there is a major disruption in supply chains, a global event like pandemic.

Yes, Covid not only disrupted our traditional supply chains, but it also wrought havoc on the regular supply of gold to the market.

For example, given the global shutdowns, that have occurred over the world, gold buyers have had to cease operations.

This meant, that the gold could not be smelted into the standardized London delivery bars.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Economy/gold/12.PNG'>
</center>

Moreover, truck and flight deliveries were delayed, as some countries decided to close borders.

Gold could not be brought to market in the same way that it always has.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Economy/gold/13.PNG'>
</center>

There was so little gold arriving on the market in London, that the spread between the comex gold futures and the spot market was the highest, that it's ever been.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Economy/gold/14.PNG'>
</center>

What should be an efficient market, can become very inefficient and illiquid with the right conditions.

So what this shows us is that, just like any other physical item, the gold supply chain is susceptible to shocks.

In this case it was a pandemic, but in future it could be something else, like war or another externality.

## GOLD'S FUNGIBILITY ASPECT

Yes, one gold bar is going to equal one gold bar.

However, you have to be sure, that you're comparing two gold bars.

There is a pretty big supply of fake gold bars on the market.

A good forger can make a pretty convincing gold bar and this stuff has made its way into global gold supply chains.

These gold-plated bars can only really be detected by those, who know what to look for, and even then some fakes are so good they fool the pros.

Fun fact: a Nasdaq listed company called *King Gold Jewellery* used gilded copper bars to secure 20 billion Won, about 2.9 billion dollars in loans from Chinese banks.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Economy/gold/15.PNG'>
</center>

One would have thought that a bank that deals in precious metals securitized lending could spot a fake, but they clearly didn't.

So your average investor may have trouble trying to determine with 100% certainty, that the bar in their hands is not just a gold wrapped hunk of junk, and even if, the bar is not fake gold.

It could be a fake of another kind.

There are a lot of illegal gold bars on the market, that have been fraudulently stamped with the logos of some well-known refineries.

These are gold bars that could have been laundered by drug cartels or illegally mined by children for some warlord.

These are a lot harder to spot, because they are after all high quality gold.

However, because you cannot verify with certainty the origin of the metal, you're always left with the possibility it could be illicit. 

## ARE THERE BETTER ALTERNATIVES?

There are way better stores of value out there.

What exactly?

The best go-to asset as a store of value is, of course, **Bitcoin**.

## BITCOIN SUPPLY

Firstly, the restricted supply.

As shown aboce, this is more of a facade, when it comes to gold. 

However, when it comes to Bitcoin supply, is completely restricted.

There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin mined.

It's protocol defined and there is no way, that any more can ever be minted.

Not a single additional Satoshi.

Moreover, the rate of supply of Bitcoin is pretty easy to determine.

You have a known Bitcoin block reward, that's earned at a relatively steady pace; about one block every 10 minutes.

This means, that you're unlikely to face a massive supply glut at any point.

No chance of a massive mining farm discovering a hidden deposit of millions of Bitcoin.

So Bitcoin really does have that scarce supply, that the gold buyers crave and think they're getting from gold.

## MOVING BITCOIN BETWEEN BORDERS

Then, the physical aspect.

Bitcoin has many advantages because it's digital.

When you own Bitcoin, you own a private key that's used to unlock a cryptographically secure asset on a decentralized ledger.

This means, that all you need to access your Bitcoin is a private key.

A private key, that can actually be unlocked through a combination of seed words.

One could literally store billions of Bitcoin in an address on a paper wallet, and memorize the seed words in a brain wallet.

That's the easiest way ever known to move billions across a border.

## BITCOIN SEIZING AND MOVING

It's also pretty hard to seize Bitcoin.

No one, apart from myself know, that this holds the key to vast untapped wealth.

Moreover, because Bitcoin is entirely digital, it can be sent across the world without any hindrance.

No need for supply chains dependent on many moving parts.

All it needs, is a simple signature and it's transferred.

This therefore means, that Bitcoin markets will never seize up, like the physical gold market can do.

Not only that, but because Bitcoin is a decentralized network of nodes computers, there's also no central point of failure.

You could literally have World War 3 going down, and the network will continue to function block after block.

## FAKE BITCOINS

You don't also have to worry about someone ever selling you fraudulent Bitcoin.

That's because it's actually impossible to create fake Bitcoin.

Every single Bitcoin in circulation is accounted for on the blockchain transparently.

It's also censorship resistant, meaning that no one can change the state of the blockchain.

When someone sends you Bitcoin, you can track the history of that coin all the way from the moment it was mined, to the moment that it landed in your wallet.

Try doing that with a gold bar.

## FINAL THOUGHTS

Gold fans see gold as a means to secure their wealth in a time of increasingly uncertain outcomes.

This is all rational and short of other alternatives.

I would also have considered gold, however there's a better alternative - Bitcoin.

This is not an absolutist stance and it's just based on pure facts.

It is a digital gold, that has those safe haven qualities, that we're all looking for.

It's completely limited in supply, whereas gold is not.

The supply emission is steady and defined, whereas gold can be chunky and uncertain.

Gold's also highly dependent on byzantine supply chains, that can be brought down by global disruptions.

Bitcoin can be moved with nothing more than a finger.

It can be transported using nothing more than memory.

It can be stored for eons in the full realization, that no one, nowhere can access it without your consent.

Gold on the other hand can be considered a liability.

Putting it this way, I would far rather be a refugee fleeing Syria or Venezuela with Bitcoin over here, than gold over here.

And of course, if I, as a refugee, do land in a safe location, I don't need to prove to any buyer, that my Bitcoin is legitimate.

No need for certificates of authenticity or refinery mints.

Just a simple blockchain explorer can prove everything the buyer needs to know.

Actually hundreds of fund managers have put their weight behind this digital rarity.

Titans of finance, such as Paul Tudor Jones and Stanley Druckenmiller have admitted their commitment, and if you look at the performance of gold and Bitcoin over the year, it's quite clear, that many other market participants are choosing the Bitcoin over the traditional of gold.

Which one do you take?
