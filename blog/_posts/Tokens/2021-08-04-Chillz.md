## TOKENIZING SPORT

The team at Chiliz is all about tokenizing the sports and entertainment sectors by creating a fan engagement platform.

Yes, that does sound great, but why on Earth would anyone want to do that, in the first place?

It's pretty sure that everyone has at least a passing interest in sports. But the deal is:

## A MERE FAN CAN'T MAKE A DECISION ON HIS TEAM... UNLESS?

Sports fans can only really watch their team, buy the merch, and buy overpriced match day treats.

In essence, we're all passive sports content consumers, and have no active influence over what happens with the team.

Actually, maybe most *normal* people like are passive sports content consumers.

It is true, that if you're a billionaire, like Sheikh Mansour, you might decide to buy a football team like Manchester City.

But for other people, there are almost no systems in place to influence their team's decisions, which is annoying for fans, when their manager or coach makes some silly decision.

Chiliz basically aims to solve that problem by giving fans a say in their team's management, as well, as a new way to engage with their team.

## WHY WOULD PLAYERS AND TEAMS AGREE TO THIS?

It's pretty cool, but why would a sports team want to give fans a say?

Surely there are a ton of highly paid bigwigs, that would be out of a job.

Well, the teams dictate the decisions that fans can influence, so some teams might not want to crowdsource that team sheet every day, which is understandable.

Most sports teams out there are businesses, and that means they need to make money.

Those star players don't tend to play for free after all.

Those key income streams would be TV rights deals, merchandise sales, and gate receipts.

And the truth is that gate receipts have been harsh on most sports teams over the last year.

However, a key way to further grow that team income, would be through opening up new ways to monetize those fans, and that's the value proposition that Chiliz offers these sports teams, by allowing them to sell fans the right to vote on specific team decisions.

A form of radical fan engagement, if you will.

## WIN-WIN FOR FANS AND TEAMS

Put simply, Chiliz offers the solution for teams to gamify team management, turn it into an entertainment proposition in its own right, and monetize the demand for these voting rights.

Fans on the other hand get a new way to support their team, and get given the opportunity to vote on certain team decisions, all of which impact on real world sporting events.

So that's a win for the team, and for the fans, who like the idea of that opportunity.

## CHILIZ ECOSYSTEM

There are two key platforms that make up Chiliz.

The first would be *socios.com*, which is that team crowd management platform.

This empowers fans to take an active role in guiding various decisions, and have an influence on events for their favorite sports teams.

That's all made possible by blockchain-based Fan Tokens, which allowed for secure and trustless deployment of tokenized voting rights, all executed by smart contracts on the *socios* platform.

So, on the *socios* app you might want to buy a Fan Token for Juventus Football Club, which would give you voting rights for certain club decisions.

However, those Fan Tokens also act a bit like loyalty cards, by giving you access to merchandise discounts and unique experiences.

That could include things like exclusive dugout access on matchdays, or getting your hands on a signed shirt from your sporting hero.

What's also important to note, is that, every sports team listed on the app has its own unique Fan Token.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/1.5.png'>
</center>

## SOCIOS.COM - KEY FUNCTIONALITIES

Basically, the *socios* app has 7 key features active right now.

##### 1. BUY CRYPTO

The first is that, **it acts as a type of fiat on-ramp into crypto**.

You can buy Chiliz tokens via the app using *Mastercard*, *Visa*, *Skrill* and *Rapid*.

You'll need Chiliz tokens to acquire the Fan Tokens for your favorite team.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/3.PNG'>
</center>

##### 2. BUY-SELL FAN COINS

Next, there's a trading section that allows you to buy and sell those Fan Tokens.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/a.png' style="max-height: 600px">
</center>

##### 3. VOTING

Then you have that all-important voting function for those that own Fan Tokens.

**This allows you to vote on things like shirt designs, the name for training grounds, and more.**

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/b.png' style="max-height: 600px">
</center>

Cypriot first division side Apollon FC kind of took the concept of fan engagement to the next level.

In a friendly match against their rivals, the team sheet and formation were picked by their fans, using *socios*.

It turns out, that the fans clearly knew a thing or two with Apollon FC emerging as 6:0 victors in that match.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/5.PNG'>
</center>

##### 4. REWARDS FOR HOLDING CRYPTO - DISCOUNTS, ETC

Some of the current benefits you can access through the app, if you hold enough Fan Tokens, are things like a 20% discount on the merchandise from certain teams.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/c.png' style="max-height: 600px">
</center>

##### 5. EARNING REWARD TOKENS

You can also earn reward tokens by engaging with the app, which you can redeem for exclusive club goodies.

##### 6. POKEMON GO

And another game in the app is socios version of *Pokemon Go*.

In short, you can chase down those Fan and Chiliz tokens in the real world via an augmented reality feature in the app.

Find those coins and you can get some of them for free.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/e.png' style="max-height: 600px">
</center>

##### 7. THE LOCKER ROOM

And finally, you can get access to something called the **locker room**.

This will be covered in a bit.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/d.png' style="max-height: 600px">
</center>

## SUPPORTED SPORTS

In terms of supported sports on the app, right now the focus is on football.

However, some esports and basketball teams are involved with, MMA coming soon too.

What's interesting is that, this model of gamification can be replicated in almost any other sports vertical.

So the potential here is truly massive.

## CHILIZ EXCHANGE

The second element of the Chiliz ecosystem would be the Chiliz Exchange.

The main draw here is all the Fan Token trading pairs, which have CHZ trading pairs only.

There are a few other regular crypto trading pairs, like CHZ-USDT, or CHZ-BTC, but the main focus is on trading those Fan Tokens.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/6.PNG'>
</center>

Also do note, that if you want to get your hands on some Chiliz or Fan Tokens, this is going to be the cheapest exchange to buy them.

**Basically, if you're using the CHZ trading pair to buy on the exchange, you'll be paying 0% in fees.**

Exchange fees to sell on CHZ trading pairs are 0.6%, with other pairs being charged at 0.2% in fees. 

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/7.PNG'>
</center>

## WHAT TEAMS HAVE PARTNERED UP WITH SOCIOS SO FAR?

It's obvious that many crypto veterans will be jaded by partnership announcements, which generally turn out to be nothing special or a pure scam.

To be fair, there are still plenty of those happening in the crypto space today, so it's pretty reasonable.

The idea of Chiliz partnering up with the likes of Barcelona, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Atletico, Madrid, and AC Milan is nothing but false promises.

However, those with a healthy dose of skepticism only need to look at these team's social accounts, and you can find mentions of both Chiliz and *socios*.

These are some of the biggest football clubs in the world, with massive fan bases, and millions of Twitter followers.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/8.PNG'>
</center>

## CHILIZ TOKENS

There are 4 types of Chiliz ecosystem tokens.

You have those **Fan Tokens**, which are issued for all sports teams partnering up with Chiliz on *socios*.

For each team a finite number of Fan Tokens are issued, with concrete voting rights, and the ability to unlock rewards and perks mentioned earlier.

Fans get those voting rights by swapping Chiliz tokens for Fan Tokens, to gain decision-making rights for that team.

**So I might own a Juventus Fan Token, and that will only let me vote on Juventus related events.**

What's super interesting here is that, these Fan Tokens have created yet another form of crypto backed fundraising - the **Fan Token Offering (FTO)**.

That's how new partners are launched on the *socios.com* platform.

In short, a fixed price per Fan Token is agreed upon by *socios* and the team.

Then, a portion of the Fan Tokens are made available on the *socios* platform for fans to buy, and users can get them at a fixed price.

A bit like an ICO, IEO or IDO.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/9.PNG'>
</center>

## WHAT'S THE DEMAND FOR SUCH A TOKEN?

Here's an interesting fact.

A recent FTO by AC Milan generated more than 6 million dollars in the first 30 minutes of launch.

So yes, there is some pretty crazy demand for these tokens.

However this is not a one-off thing.

In 2021 Chiliz claims, that Fan Tokens generated over 30 million dollars in revenue for sports teams and partners via FTOs in 2022.

Pretty handy for teams suffering from those low gate receipts due to the pandemic.

## TOKEN BURNINGS INCENTIVE

Earlier in the year Chiliz announced Fan Token burn mechanisms.

Essentially, the better the team performs, and the more Fan Token holders there are, the fewer tokens that will be in circulation.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/10.png'>
</center>

An example of that can be seen over here.

Let's say, we hold the Barcelona Fan Tokens here.

20,000 of these Fan Tokens were burned per goal, and 40,000 were burned, if Barcelona won.

It is true, that football fans are maybe even more tribal, than the crypto community, and the demand for them seems to have been validated.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/11.jpg'>
</center>

## TOKENOMICS

Usually only a very small percentage of the total supply is circulating.

Take the Paris Saint-Germain Fan Token for example.

Just 6 of the 20 million total supply is circulating.

The rest of the tokens held by PSG Football Club have a linear vesting schedule of 8 years with 2.5 million being released per year.

That's about double the current circulating supply.

There is surely going to be quite a bit of inflation.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/12.PNG'>
</center>

After all, the same is true of Juventus Fan Tokens with just 1.3 million tokens circulating with a total supply of 20 million.

The rest of those Fan Tokens have that same monthly linear vesting schedule of 8 years with 2.5 million youth tokens being released every year.


<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/13.PNG'>
</center>

Now, many sports fans don't know about the importance of tokenomics.

They are likely to just buy those tokens because they like a certain team.

We all have friends, who are likely to be in that category.

## INFLATION AND DEMAND

So, the main question should be *"Will demand for fan tokens outstrip their pretty crazy inflation rate?"*.

If that's the case, then we can expect the token price to increase.

If you're interested in checking out all the different Fan Tokens and their perspective market caps, then you might want to check out <a href="https://fantokenrank.com/" target="_blank">fantokenrank.com</a>.

It's basically like a *CoinMarketCap* for Fan Tokens only. Secondly you have the Chiliz or CHZ token. 

## PAY ATTENTION WHEN BUYING!

Both an ERC-20 utility token and a BEP-2 token on the Binance Chain, so be sure not to mix things up, if you're depositing or withdrawing from an exchange.

CHZ tokens are basically used as the fuel for the Chiliz ecosystem, and are used by fans to acquire those all-important Fan Tokens for any of the teams partnered with *socios.com*.

The way, we can think of them, is that they act in a similar way to ETH back in its crazy ICO days of 2017, except they're for Fan Token Offerings.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/14.PNG'>
</center>

## POTENTIAL FUTURE PLANS TO INCREASE DEMAND

The next use case of the CHZ token hasn't gone live yet, however, in the near future MMA fans will be able to buy UFC tickets with Chiliz tokens.

Chiliz will also be giving out VIP experiences for specific UFC events.

Those sorts of unique experiences could lead to an increase in demand for CHZ tokens.

That's very unlinkely however to think, that Chiliz will expand similar options to sports teams partnered with the platform.

It's also true, that CHZ can be used as a store, and transfer of value like every other cryptocurrency and they can be traded on exchanges.

## TOKENOMICS OF CHZ

There are not many recent information on the tokenomics, so we'll have to use the outline from 2019.

That outlines that 20 of net trading fees on the Chiliz exchange will be burned, so will 10 of the net proceeds from FTOs and 20 of the proceeds from NFTs and collectibles.

That announcement for version 2.0 of Chiliz token economics states, that those terms for burning CHZ are valid till June 2020, when they'll be reviewed.

Sadly, that's impossible to find more recent information on that.

However, Chiliz did tweet earlier in 2021 that the first burn of the year was based on that token economics announcement, and that 11 million CHZ tokens had been sent to the incinerator.

That token burn was worth around 5.5 million dollars at the time of shooting this video.

Not too large an amount, given that the project commands a market cap of just over 2.5 billion.

## THE LOCKER ROOM TOKENS

The third type of Chiliz token would be **Locker Tokens**.

What are those?

In the *socios* app there's a feature, called *the Socios Locker Room*.

Its purpose is to show potential partner clubs, how much demand there is for their team's Fan Tokens.

It's basically *socios* users saying "*Hey, Mr. Sports Club, we really want you to do a Fan Token with socios!*".

The team at *socios* create a locker for each potential partner club.

These are open for 120 days.

Users can put CHZ tokens into the locker, and you get Locker Tokens in return.

If the partner decides to launch a Fan Token, then these Locker Tokens are swapped for official Fan Tokens at a rate of one to one.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/15.PNG'>
</center>

## WHAT'S THE PROFIT FROM LOCKER ROOMS?

But why bother with this? What's the incentive?

If a potential partner doesn't opt to launch their Fan Token in the specified time period, then you get your CHZ tokens back.

However, if the club does go ahead with that, you've secured your allocation of Fan Tokens, and you get 10% of the money you initially invested in.

Bonus CHZ cashback. 

The interesting side effect of this Locker Room mechanic is that, it essentially replicates staking by taking CHZ tokens off the open market, and reducing the tradable supply.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/16.PNG'>
</center>

## ERC-1155 TOKEN - FOR UNIQUE TOKENS

The final type of token in the Chiliz ecosystem, would be the ERC-1155 NFTs. 

Basically *socios* teamed up with engine to create Ethereum based collectibles for partner clubs.

A few weeks ago, Chiliz also announced it had integrated with Chainlink to mint NFTs in real time.

So why is that a big deal?

It allows Chiliz to create dynamic NFTs in response to real world sporting events and mint limited edition NFTs.

For example, if a player scores their 100th goal then limited edition NFTs might be minted to commemorate it.

There are also the likes of Paris Saint-Germain tweeting about *socios* NFTs too, and here's AC Milan letting their fans know, that they should get ready for AC Milan NFT collectibles.

## CHILIZ - REWARDS TIED WITH NTFS

When it comes to NFTs and sport, it all makes a ton of sense.

Think about the crazy money that sports fans are willing to pay for collectibles, like memorabilia and sports cards.

But what really sets Chiliz apart from others in the NFT space is that, they understand that NFTs need to have value, if prices are going to be supported long term.

At the moment, they are focused on rewards.

So an example of that would be the ownership of a specific Juventus NFT could lead to being granted exclusive access to a VIP box at the stadium.

What's even more exciting is that, we can see how those types of NFTs could really appeal to no coiner sports fans too.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/17.PNG'>
</center>

## WORTH THE HYPE?

Fan Tokens are really hard to value, and that's because sports fans can really be quite irrational, when it comes to their teams.

There are guys, that would spend over a thousand of dollrs and days traveling to away games in far-flung places.

This even though their team frankly has little hope of winning.

When you have fans behaving so emotionally, it's honestly very difficult to gauge your value for these token types.

With the CHZ token, I think in the medium to long term that it's very simple.

If the platform does well, so will the token.

But I would urge people to be careful, and think about their entry point, if they're considering getting some CHZ.

Locker Tokens do seem like a good way to give yourself a chance of making a better return on the CHZ or you'd be interested in getting exposure to a certain Fan Token, if it was launched.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/2.PNG'>
</center>

## CHZ ON BINANCE

Finally, on the Chiliz NFT front.

It all depends on the perks, that can be unlocked by holding these NFTs.

If they unlock great exclusive rewards, or unique experiences, that fans really want, then no doubt, that they'll command sky high prices.

Imagine the demand for an NFT amongst football fans, that allowed you to meet up with Lionel Messi once a year.

Every fan and football youtuber under the sun would want a piece of that one.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/18.PNG'>
</center>

## PARTNESHIPS

But what about Chiliz partnerships?

Well, there is a very important one.

Binance is both a partner and investor in Chiliz.

That's why almost every Fan Token and the CHZ token is listed on Binance.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/19.PNG'>
</center>

It also gave access to certain Fan Tokens, like PSG and you have on the Binance launch pool.

If liquidity is something that concerns you, then honestly it's worth considering trading them on Binance every day of the week.

That trade volume and liquidity is typically way better, than the Chiliz exchange itself.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/20.PNG'>
</center>

Probably not a surprise to anyone out there, also Binance frankly offers way more trading pairs.

<center>
<img src='/images/posts/Tokens/chiliz/21.PNG'>
</center>

## FANS ARE GOOD CUSTOMERS

Honestly, I know firsthand, how passionate sports fans can be.

I wonder, if fan tokens could end up becoming a bit like how diamonds are.

More or bigger diamonds equals more love or, in terms of Fan Tokens, that would be more Fan Tokens, the bigger a supporter you really are.

Let's face it, there are billions of sports fans out there in the world, and almost everyone I know seems to love the idea of being able to influence their team's decisions and get exclusive perks.

Overall, Chiliz as a project is really ambitious, the concept, and how they're seemingly paving the way for unique digital sports memorabilia with NFTs in real time.

Also the idea of attaching tangible team-related perks to NFTs is absolutely brilliant.

That way they have tangible real-world value, and this should drive future demand.

There are plenty of countries in the world, where gambling on sports is illegal.

Think of the likes of China, where people are football crazy.

What Fan Tokens also allow people to do, is to speculate on the success of teams.

Due to that, Fan Token burn mechanism, and how in theory teams should be more popular the more they win.

In a way, it's kind of like an indirect way of betting on them too.

## EXPANDING - HOW CRAZY WOULD THAT BE?

There are billions of sports fans around the world.

The majority would probably be open to using a platform like *socios*.

That's a a lot of new people, who could be introduced to the world of crypto, and that's what makes Chiliz so intriguing as a platform.

Also think about this potential to add more teams and sports.

Accoring to the rumours, Chiliz might be planning on expanding into the US with a 50 million dollar investment.

How crazy that could be, if they got some big F1 teams onto the platform.

But with all that being said, I do believe that Chiliz long-term success rests on voting power, and rewards, that fans really care about.

In a crazy world, where anything seems possible, is it really so far-fetched to think that even major decisions, like transfers team sheets and formations, could be decided by fans in the future.

That's perhaps something almost every sports fan would be interested in.
