### WHAT IS UNISWAP?

Uniswap is a decentralized,  permissionless exchange that allows anyone to trade  Ethereum ERC-20 tokens directly without the use of a middleman.

To understand  what makes Uniswap different, let’s start out by taking a look at how  a traditional cryptocurrency exchange, like Kraken or Bitstamp works.

### FIRST - HOW TRADITIONAL EXCHANGES WORK
To begin with,  traditional exchanges are centralized, meaning they are owned  by a company that has complete control  over the exchange and the computers that run it.

Traditional exchanges  are also regulated by KYC laws, which is an abbreviation for  ‘Know Your Customer’.

These laws require  each new customer to provide extensive  personal information, including your home address  and tax ID numbers before you can begin trading  on the exchange.

Additionally, in order to trade  on a traditional exchange, users need to deposit money  on the exchange, basically giving the exchange  control over their funds.

On a traditional exchange, when users want to buy or sell  a certain cryptocurrency they submit a “Buy” or “Sell” order.

All of these orders are recorded  in the exchange’s order book.

Once there’s a match  between a buyer and a seller, a trade is conducted.

So this is how a traditional,  centralized exchange works.

### DEX - DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGES
Now let’s talk about  decentralized exchanges, also known as DEXs.

DEXs are part of the decentralized  finance ecosystem.

Decentralized finance,  or DeFi for short, is a term given to traditional  financial services such as exchanges,  lending services, and insurance, that have been decentralized through the use  of Blockchain technology.

### DEX AND SMART CONTRACTS
Now, unlike a traditional exchange that requires a controlling company  and centralized servers to operate, a DEX consists of a set of smart  contracts deployed on a blockchain.

In simple terms,  it’s a set of automated rules that are executed by a network  of independent computers without any central entity controlling it.


### MORE ADVANTAGES OF DEXs

Since DEXs aren’t controlled  by anyone, they can’t be regulated  and are in fact open to everyone.

When using a DEX  there’s no need to open an account, or go through an identification process where you’d have to supply  your personal information.

Additionally DEXs allow users  to trade directly from their own wallets allowing them to keep full control  over their funds.

### DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEX AND TRADITIONAL
A key difference a DEX has  from a traditional exchange is in the way transactions  are conducted and how price is determined.

As I’ve mentioned earlier, in a traditional exchange buyers and sellers set  their price expectations as “Buy” and “Sell” orders  inside the order book.

The more buyers and sellers  an exchange has, the larger its order book and the more “liquid”  the exchange is said to be.

In other words, it’s easier to find a buyer and a seller  that agree on a price and make a trade.

## LIQUIDITY
Imagine there are only 2 buyers  and 2 sellers on a certain exchange.

It would be very hard for any trade  to get executed, since it's unlikely to find two people  who would agree on a price.

Without liquidity  the exchange is practically dead since no trades can be conducted.

It’s the same as having a shopping mall with very few stores  or and customers.

There’s not a lot of business  that will be done there.

In fact, liquidity is such  an important criteria to determine the quality  of an exchange, that some exchanges use  external services called “market makers” that are willing to buy and sell  at all times, creating constant liquidity  for the exchange.

### LIQUIDITY IN DEXs
DEXs, on the other hand,  don’t store any user funds and have no order book.

Liquidity on DEXs is created  through liquidity pools.

Liquidity pools are  a shared pot of funds deposited by the general public, and DEXs use liquidity pools  in order to fulfill “buy” and “sell” orders.

People who deposit funds  in liquidity pools are known as liquidity providers  or LPs.

In exchange for the locked funds, LPs receive a part  of the DEX’s trading fees in a process known as  liquidity mining.

### DETERMINCE THE PRICE - TRADITIONAL
Now that we’ve covered  the differences in how liquidity is provided between  traditional and decentralized exchanges, let’s talk about how the price  of a certain coin is determined.

On a traditional exchange, when a seller and buyer reach  an agreement through matching orders  in the exchange order book, a trade is conducted.

At that point the price of the coin  is determined until another trade is executed  at a different price.

In other words, the price of the most recent trade  is considered the current price on the exchange.

### DETERMINE THE PRICE - DEX
A decentralized exchange  on the other hand, doesn’t have an order book.

Users don’t trade with one another, they trade within a liquidity pool.

And instead of using the last trade  to determine the price, a mathematical formula is used.

This formula, or algorithm,  is called an Automated Market Maker or AMM for short.

Uniswap uses an AMM called  “Constant Product Market Maker Model” to determine the price of coins  on its exchange.

This AMM follows a simple formula  of X times Y equals K.

This means that when trading,  for example, Ether for DAI the amount of Ether available  times the amount of DAI available on Uniswap’s Ether/DAI liquidity pool  should always equal a constant number.

Imagine there are 10 ETH  and 10,000 DAI on a certain liquidity pool.

As we can see,  using the AMM model this means that the number of ETH times the number of DAI equals 100,000,  this is our constant K.

If I were to buy 1 ETH, this will reduce the number of ETH  in the pool to 9.

Now the question remains,  how many DAI will this cost.

Well, the way to calculate this  is to take our constant of 100,000 and divide it  by the new number of ETH, 9.

This would give us the new number  of DAI required in our pool - 11,111.

Meaning we need to deposit  around 1,111 DAI to buy one ETH.

As you can see the price is determined by how much of a certain token  you want to buy, and not by how much someone else  wants to get for it.

### DRAWBACK
By using the  “Constant Product  Market Maker Model” algorithm, liquidity is kept without the need  for external market makers, no matter how large the order size  or how tiny the liquidity pool.

This model makes it infinitely expensive to consume the whole amount  of a certain coin, putting a damper on larger orders.

For example,  In our previous exercise, if I wanted to buy 9 ETH  it would cost me 90,000 DAI to maintain the 100,000 constant, making each ETH cost 10,000 DAI  instead of the 1,111 DAI it would cost to buy only 1 ETH.

### DIFFERENT SWAPS - DIFFERENT AMMs
Of course there are other DEXs  with different AMM algorithms than the one used on Uniswap, but that conversation goes beyond  the scope of this video.

### ABOUT UNISWAP
Now that we’ve covered DEXs we can focus on Uniswap more in depth.

Uniswap is a DEX built on top of  the Ethereum network infrastructure.

It’s a set of automated rules  used for trading ERC-20 tokens, which is a term given to a certain  standard of Ethereum tokens.

Uniswap is the most popular  decentralized application, or DAPP, on the Ethereum platform with hundreds of thousands of users  trading on it each week.

Additionally Uniswap is one of  the most forked projects in the DeFi space, meaning people use its code  to build additional applications.

### V1, V2 AND V3
##### V1 - 11.2018
The first version of Uniswap  started out in November of 2018.

Uniswap’s V1 allowed trading  of any ERC-20 token to Ether and back.

##### V2 - 05.2020

In May of 2020 V2 was released and the trading of ERC-20 tokens  directly between one another without first having to trade with Ether  became available.

##### V3 - 05.2021

In May of 2021 V3 was released allowing a more effective use of capital to whoever decides to supply  liquidity to Uniswap.

In other words you can squeeze more “juice”  out of the money you deposit in the liquidity pool.

Trading also got more efficient, lowering trading costs compared to V2.

### HOW TO USE UNISWAP
So how do you actually use Uniswap?

Well, it’s fairly simple, all you need is an Ethereum wallet  like Metamask which can interact  with other Ethereum applications.

Once you have Metamask  installed on your browser, head over to Uniswap.org,  click on “Connect Wallet”, choose “Metamask” and now you can start trading  any Ethereum ERC-20 token that is listed.

### SLIPPAGE
Keep in mind that since there are  many people conducting trades on Uniswap simultaneously, the price shown  when you place your order may be different from the actual price  when the order is executed.

This phenomenon is called “Slippage” and you are able to cap  how much slippage you are willing to tolerate  before cancelling your order.

The reason for slippage is that every  trade on Uniswap  is actually an Ethereum transaction and it can take some time  to broadcast the transaction and get it confirmed  by the Ethereum network.

By the time the transaction  is confirmed, the price may have already changed.

### SCAM COINS ON UNISWAP
Due to its decentralized  and non-regulated nature, Uniswap supports many types  of ERC-20 tokens.

In fact, practically anyone  can create their own token and list it on Uniswap for free, filling Uniswap with a wide variety  of tokens but unfortunately a fair number  of scam coins as well.

Just because a coin is listed  on Uniswap doesn’t mean it’s legit  or has any intrinsic value.

As opposed to a traditional exchange that does extensive due diligence  and research on every coin it adds to its platform ,  Uniswap doesn’t. 

So - it’s up to you to Do Your  Own Research as they say and decide if you want to invest  in a certain coin.

### UNI TOKEN
Finally, let’s talk about the UNI token.

A coin that has gradually made its way  to the list of top cryptocurrencies.

In September of 2020 Uniswap introduced the UNI token  through an airdrop.

Meaning, each person  who previously used Uniswap received 400 UNI tokens for free.

Even though the UNI token  has risen substantially in value since its release, it wasn’t designed to serve  as a currency.

It’s actually a governance token, allowing whoever holds it to influence  and vote on development decisions.

The more tokens you hold,  the more voting power you have.

The idea is for the Uniswap team  to gradually fade out their involvement in Uniswap and leave the management  of the project to the token holders.

### THE VALUE OF UNI
So how is it that a token that wasn’t meant to have any value  rose to the top of the cryptocurrency list?

Well…it seems that the price of UNI represents how valuable people believe  that Uniswap will be in the future, and therefore are willing to pay  to be a part of its governing body.

In the cryptocurrency space it’s not uncommon for coins that never had any intention  of being used as a financial asset to become very valuable.

In the end it’s up to you to decide if being a part of the Uniswap  governing body is worth the price of the UNI token.

# Hopefully by now you understand  what Uniswap is - a decentralized exchange that allows users to trade  any ERC-20 token without any intermediary.
