## HISTORY

Shiba Inu was created in August 2020, by a pseudonymous developer named Ryoshi.

Although Shiba Inu is branded as the "*Dogecoin Killer*", Ryoshi explained in his first Medium post, that the project is essentially an experiment in community governance and decentralization.

Ryoshi came up with the idea for Shiba Inu with an anonymous friend, who he'd met at the Ethereum Devcon conference in Japan in 2019.

This anonymous friend is the one, who created the SHIB token smart contract on Ethereum, and also provided 10 ETH as liquidity for an ETH ship trading pair on the Uniswap decentralized exchange.

According to Ryoshi, this anonymous friend is a "*successful businessman*", so 10 ETH is nothing for him.

## RYOSHI'S POSTS ON MEDIUM AND FIRST WOOF PAPER

After the initial hype died down, Shiba Inu went into hibernation until February this year, when Ryoshi posted another article on Medium.

In it he explained, that Shiba Inu's return is because, with the resurgence of DOGE, SHIB has caught fire, and is threatening to turn over the entire market.

The final sentence in the post also stuck out for me, and it reads:

**I don't like centralized exchanges. Often times they destroy community projects by price suppressions. I do not endorse any, and only encourage you to use Uniswap and DEX.**

Shiba Inu's first news mention came in mid-March, and it was about a 300 price pump caused by Elon Musk's tweet, that he would be getting a shiba inu dog.

About one month later, the Shiba Inu community released the first version of their white paper, which is of course called the Woof Paper.

SHIB's similarities to DOGE caused it, and other dog themed tokens to dominate the headlines in May, especially when Vitalik announced his massive SHIB burn and donation.

## SHIBA ECOSYSTEM

As Shiba Inu's own website explains:

**SHIB is no longer just a meme token, it is a part of a larger ecosystem being built by the shiba inu community.**

Most of this ecosystem centers around DeFi, specifically the **Shibaswap decentralized exchange**, whose code is currently being audited by Certig.

Like some other DEXs, Shibaswap's launch will begin with a two-week liquidity event, which will incentivize liquidity providers to move their LP tokens from Uniswap and Sushiswap to Shibaswap.

## DEXES AND LIQUIDITY PROVIDING

Liquidity Provider Tokens or LP tokens are given to users, who give two cryptocurrencies to a decentralized exchange to earn fees for that trading pair.

For example, if you provide ETH and USDC liquidity to the ETH-USDC Uniswap pool, you will receive an equivalent amount of LP tokens.

These LP tokens represent the ETC and USDC you locked in the Uniswap pool.

Each LP token type is fungible i.e, identical, and can easily be traded with other users 
by incentivizing Sniswap and Sushiswap LPs to move their LP tokens to Shibaswap.

It becomes possible to do something called a **Vampire Attack**, wherein all the liquidity on a DEX is swapped to another.

In plain English, it makes it possible to take most of the cryptocurrency trading pair value from one DEX and move it to another DEX.

This is exactly what the Shiba Inu community is looking to do, and they're hoping to lure dog-minded LPs to their decks with bones, literally.

## BONE TOKEN

BONE is an ERC20 token on Ethereum and a part of Shiba Inu's upcoming ecosystem.

BONE is not yet in circulation.

The BONE you'll find on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko is related to a different dog project.

Shiba Inu's BONE will be given as reward to stakers and liquidity providers on the Shibaswap DEX, and it will also give governance rights to its holders, where 1 BONE equals 1 vote.

BONE can also be staked to earn more BONE and providing liquidity for the BONE-ETH pair, will allow BONE ease LPs to earn 0.1% of all DAI and USDT swap transactions.

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/shiba/bone1.png">
</center>

An interesting setup, to say the least.

BONE will have a maximum supply of 250 million, and a predetermined amount of BONE will be generated per Ethereum block, until it reaches its maximum supply.

In a few years this emission schedule can be seen in the image here.

It's worth noting, that it's extremely aggressive.

## MULTI SIGNATURE WALLETS

During Shibaswap's two-week liquidity event to incentivize LPs to migrate their LP tokens from other DEXs, a small portion of the BONE per block will be allocated to a multi-signature development wallet, to ensure the long-term sustainability of the project.

## GOVERNMENT STAY AWAY

On that note, it's worth pointing out, that the first version of Shiba Inu's Woof Paper notes, that centralized exchanges will not be allowed to earn any BONE rewards from Shibaswap, whereas the second version specifies, that "*unaffiliated centralized exchanges will be barred from earning BONE rewards*". 

This is one of the few changes between the two Woof Papers with most relating to the BONE rewards earned by stakers and LPs, which deal in not just BONE and SHIB but another token called LEASH.

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/shiba/grr.png">
</center>

## LEASH

LEASH is another ERC20 token on Ethereum, and also part of Shiba Inu's upcoming ecosystem.

LEASH is in circulation as of April, and it was initially designed to "*Tame DOGE by rebasing to 1000x the price of DOGE at 630 UTC every day.*".

**Now as a simple example, if DOGE is worth 1 cent at that time LEASH will rebase to 10 dollars.**

Ryoshi's reasoning behind LEASH is to "*offer a synth to hedge the price of DOGE"*.

Anyways, LEASH is no longer a rebase token.

It has a maximum supply just north of 107 000 LEASH, all of which is in circulation.

This low supply is why LEASH has such a high dollar value.

In case you didn't know, while LEASH has no use case per se, it can be staked to earn BONE and those, who provide liquidity for the LEASH-ETH pair will earn 0.1% of all wrapped BTC and USDC swap transactions.

## SHIB

This brings us to our third and last token, and that's SHIB.

SHIB is an ERC20 token on Ethereum, and the flagship token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem.

SHIB had an initial supply of one quadrillion.

50% of this supply went to the initial ETH-SHIB pool on Uniswap, and the remainder was sent to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin's cold wallet address by Shiba Inu's founder.

## VITALIK AND INDIA CHARITY

The reason why Ryoshi did this is not entirely clear, but it was likely for marketing purposes.

Since many other cryptocurrency projects have tried running campaigns saying Vitalik supports their project after sending their tokens to Vitalik's wallet address without his knowledge.

Whether Vitalik had advanced knowledge of this token transfer in particular is something I'll dig into later.

According to Vitalik, he noticed earlier this year that he had billions of dollars of a token called SHIB in his cold wallet address.

At the time Vitalik was a billionaire from his ETH holdings alone.

So he figured that donating these dog tokens would be the best course of action.
 
There's just one problem, and that's that Vitalik was stuck overseas, because of the pandemic, and part of his cold wallet address was at his parents home in Canada.

After assembling the full seed phrase, Vitalik accessed his cold wallet, and proceeded to burn 80% of the SHIB tokens he'd been given.

He then donated the remaining 20% to various organizations and causes, notably the India Coveted Relief Fund and an institute, which specializes in longevity research.

There are apparently other organizations, which have yet to announce, that they've received SHIB tokens from Vitalik as a donation.

Now, this is important to note, because it's been falsely reported, that Vitalik burned 90% of his SHIB, and donated the rest to just the India Covert Relief Fund.

In any case, the total value of the SHIB Vitalik burned was over 6 billion dollars at the time.

It's unlikely that this money could have been cashed out, because of market depth, but that's neither here nor there.

## SHIB TOKEN

As with LEASH, SHIB does not have a specific use case, however SHIB can be staked to earn a boat load of BONE in addition to 0.1% of all ETH swap transaction fees on Shibaswap, which is likely to be lucrative.

## SHIB PRICE PREDICTION

SHIB was worth next to nothing, until the end of February, when its price started to spike alongside DOGE.

SHIB continued rising into March and April, and peaked in mid-May at 3000 of a cent, after its binance listing announcement.

The massive crash that came shortly afterwards was caused by a combination of cell pressure from SHIB donation recipients, coupled with the general crash of the crypto market.

Even though SHIB has fallen from grace, it still somehow has a market cap of over 3.3 billion dollars and this brings a very important point.

**Will never reach a cent much less a dollar, and that's because its supply is so massive.**
 
This is something that the average crypto investor doesn't seem to understand.

Raching a dollar would give SHIB a market cap of nearly 400 billion dollars, which would make it larger than Ethereum. That's not going to happen.

## PEAK IN FUTURE BC OF UNEXPERIENCED INVESTORS

That said, SHIB still seems to have some potential.

Given that it's moments away from releasing the Shibaswap DEX, which will drive demand, that doesn't depend on Dogecoin.

We could potentially see SHIB retest its previous all-time high, especially if the rest of the crypto market is moving in the same direction.

SHIB's Coinbase listing will certainly help, as retail traders pile in under the pretense, that they'll get rich, if it goes to a dollar, which again, isn't going to happen.

## NOT LISTED ON COINBASE

On that note, you might be wondering, why SHIB isn't trading on Coinbase already.

Well, apparently, this is due to technical issues on Coinbase's side, which also delayed the listing of Solana's SOL by over a month.

The strange thing is that, SHIB isn't on its own blockchain.

It's an ERC20 token.

Now, ERC20 tokens are extremely easy to list on an exchange, so this may mean, that there are other reasons for SHIB's Coinbase listing delay, and one of these might relate to the Shibaswap DEX. 

Coinbase tends to list cryptocurrencies that are complete, and Shiba Inu won't be complete until the Shibaswap DEX launches.

Rather than backtrack on their listing announcement, Coinbase might be claiming technical issues to buy time, so as not to set a bad precedent for future token listings.

## SHIBA SWAP AND UNISWAP V3

So when could we see the Shibaswap?

DEX members of the Shiba Inu community have already released DEX demos on Youtube, so we know it's not just smoke and mirrors.

Shibaswap has actually been in the works for quite some time, and I suspect that the launch was delayed after the release of Uniswap V3.

This is because LP tokens on Uniswap V3 are non-fungible.

They're literally like NFTs, and this means that other DEXs can't pull off the sort of Vampire Attack.

Shibaswap will be released once Certik completes its audit of the code.

While there does not appear to be a set date for this, I couldn't help but notice, that the latest Woof Paper shows BONE's emission schedule beginning on July the 1st this year.

## NEW TOKENS - DAO AND TREAT

As with the first Woof Paper, the second version also reiterates the fact, that the official road map for Shiba Inu is *top secret*.

Though it does offer a few hints as to what comes next after Shibaswap.

The first thing we will see after Shibaswap launches, is the introduction of a 4th token called TREAT, whose tokenomics have yet to be detailed.

All we know is that, it will be a *very special token*.

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/Tokens/shiba/treat.png">
</center>

Later this year, we will see the formation of the "*DOGGY DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization, that will govern the Shiba Inu ecosystem*".

No fixed date has yet been provided for the DAO.

## SHIBARIUM - ETHEREUM TOKEN ANDSTABLE COIN SHE

Shiba Inu's longer-term roadmap was detailed by Ryoshi in his most recent Medium post, at the end of May, and it contains some pretty ambitious goals.

The first is the creation of a layer 2 blockchain for Ethereum called **Shibarium**, which will have BONE as its native token.

Ryoshi notes, that he's reached out to a team, which will develop this blockchain pro bono and i suspect it might be Polygon.

Given Ryoshi's description of Shibarium, the second goal depends on the first, and that's a creation of a stable coin called SHE, that's pegged to 1 cent.

With SHE and Shibarium, Ryoshi hopes that Shiba Inu will finally become the "Dogecoin Killer" it was bred to be.

Did I mention, that it will do DeFi as well, or should i say Sheepfire.

## SHIBACONS

Anyways, the final goal detailed by Ryoshi involves the creation of ShibaCon, an annual crypto conference for Shiba Inu enthusiasts.

Tentative dates and locations have already been set for the first 3 ShibaCon conferences.

## WHO'S RYOSHI?

Who the hell is Ryoshi?

Ryoshi's identity has yet to be revealed, however, what we do know about him suggests that this whole Shiba Inu saga didn't happen by accident.

Ryoshi's first Medium post finishes with a rare photo of Vitalik Butarian in Japan, presumably during DevCon in 2019 

The man in the brown jacket is apparently Ryoshi himself.

If this is true, then Vitalik may be the anonymous friend, Ryoshi credits for creating the Shiba Inu smart contract, and providing the initial ETH liquidity for SHIB on Uniswap.

More importantly, it's not just Vitalik, who's in that photo.

Ethereum foundation director Aya Miyaguchi is also seen walking with the group, which presumably contains individuals of similar stature.

Regardless of who Ryoshi is, it's clear, that he has close connections to some very important people in crypto, and this means, that he's not just some anonymous developer who came out of nowhere.

## RYOSHI ROLE

Ryoshi is probably not some sort of malicious actor looking to get rich quick.

Quite the contrary.

In fact, Ryoshi apparently has 0 stake in SHIB, and only bought a bit at the beginning on Uniswap, like everyone, else before selling shortly afterwards.

This is easily verified by checking SHIB's distribution on EtherScan, which is pretty equitable for a meme token.

What's more is that, even though Ryoshi put this project into motion he doesn't seem to play a very important role at all.

Almost everything about Shiba Inu has been made by its community so much, so that Shiba Inu's own social media accounts have been hijacked on multiple occasions by bad actors, looking to undermine the project Dogecoin sympathizes.

Perhaps as many questions, as there still are around Shiba Inu, there's no doubt, that this is a dog crypto unlike any other, and it may in fact be the Dogecoin Killer.

## SHIBA AND DOGE

So is Shiba Inu is a coin?

It definitely doesn't fall into the same category as most other meme coins.

Shiba Inu's origin story is eerily similar to Dogecoins.

Both began as a joke, and were it not for Elon Musk's tweets, they would both be dead altcoins.

Where Shiba Inu and Dogecoin differ, is the connections they have to the crypto community.

DOGE is really just a meme and nothing more.

All the development and growth seems to be coming from a handful of fanboys, who have probably lost touch with reality by now.

By contrast, SHIB is close to becoming a big player in Ethereum's ecosystem by overcoming the shortcomings of Dogecoin as community driven as Shiba Inu is.

## SHIBA AND VITALIK

There definitely seemed to be some seriously prolific people behind the project, it wouldn't be surprising at all, if Ryoshi is in fact someone well-known and liked by the Ethereum foundation.

You don't just magically find yourself hanging out with Vitalik.

Vitalik also fits the profile of a "*successful businessman*", who has no shortage of ETH, and also has a history of handing out cryptocurrency to projects and causes he believes in.

It's likely that Vitalik knew about his SHIB allocation in advance, but like Ryoshi, Vitalik probably didn't think Shiba Inu would become a billion dollar enterprise.

The dollar amount of SHIB he donated, corresponds to the dollar amount, he held in other cryptocurrencies at the time.

Not familiar with Canadian tax law, but probably gifts are not taxed, and that SHIB donation is probably tax deductible.

If that's correct, this would make it possible for Vitalik to sell over a billion dollars in cryptocurrency tax-free this year, if he wanted to.

If that's the case, he deserves it.

## CONCLUSIONS

If Shiba Inu shows anything, it's that, it really doesn't take that much to make money in cryptocurrency.

The question is, how you use that money to make something meaningful, that will last and benefit everyone involved, not just the people who got in early.

This idea lies at the heart of Shiba Inu, and even though the project isn't appealing enough, that is something to respect.
