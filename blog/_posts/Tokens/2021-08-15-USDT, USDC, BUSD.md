## STABLECOINS RECENTLY

Stablecoins have been in the spotlight over the last few weeks, and for all the wrong reasons.

Regulators are starting to get nervous about the impact stablecoins could have not just on the crypto market, but on the financial markets as a whole.

This is because the total market cap of all stablecoins combined currently stands at more than 100 billion dollars and counting this wouldn't be a problem. if not for the fact, that the issuers of these stablecoins have not been very transparent about the assets, which back their dollar pegged tokens.

This is a problem, because if everyone went to cash out their stablecoins at the same time, there's no telling, what could happen.

As it so happens, some of the largest stablecoin issuers recently revealed this information, and we now know the assets that back the three largest stablecoins in circulation.

## REASON FOR THE STABLECOINS

**Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies, that are designed to mirror the price of a regular fiat currency, usually the us dollar.**

Before stablecoins existed, traders would have to send their crypto, usually BTC, to a crypto-fiat payment gateway, whenever they wanted to capitalize on a gain or cut their losses.

This was not very efficient, because moving between crypto and fiat often incurred a lot of fees, and a busy blockchain or exchange could mean losing some of your gains or deepening your losses due to delays and downtime.

Stablecoins make it possible to cash out without actually having to convert your cryptocurrency.

Interfered trading against a stablecoin also makes it much easier to calculate your gains and losses.

This is why stablecoins are so popular, and it's also why most of the trading volume for any given coin or token comes from stablecoin pairs.

## DEMAND FOR STABLECOINS AND PRICE OF THE COIN

Generally speaking, there are three types of stablecoin:
- crypto,
- backed, and 
- algorithmic

All of them ultimately maintain their dollar pegs by adjusting their supply based on demand.

**When demand for a stablecoin is high enough, this can push its price above a dollar.**

This usually happens whenever the crypto market is dropping like a rock, because everyone is rushing to buy stablecoins to protect their portfolios from further losses.

</center>

Eventually new stablecoins are minted to meet this demand and restore the dollar peg.

</center>

Conversely, when people start selling their stablecoins to buy whichever crypto is currently going to the moon **this sometimes manages to push the price of stable coins below a dollar.**

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/stablecoins/3.png">
</center>

When this happens, stablecoins are burned to reduce the supply, thereby raising the token's price to put it back in line with its dollar peg.

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/stablecoins/whale2.png">
</center>

Whereas crypto, backed and algorithmic stablecoins have automatic and incentive-based systems, which mint and burn tokens to meet demand, fiat-backed stablecoins rely on the companies which issued them to do this.

</center>

## BURNING AND MINTING STABLECOINS

In theory, the companies which issue fiat-backed stablecoins have an equivalent amount of dollars in the bank to back the tokens in circulation, across all cryptocurrency blockchains.

When fiat-backed stablecoins are minted, this means, that someone somewhere went to the company behind that stablecoin, and gave them dollars in exchange for tokens, which are then put into circulation.

When fiat-backed stablecoins are burned, this means that someone somewhere went to the company behind the stablecoin, and gave them tokens in exchange for dollars, which then takes those dollars out of circulation.

Having this one-to-one ratio of dollars to tokens is extremely important, because if there was ever a "*black swan event*", that caused everyone to cash out of crypto, not having sufficient dollars in the bank means, not everyone would actually be able to convert their digital dollars into physical dollars.

As mentioned before, fiat back stablecoin issuers have historically not been very transparent about whether their tokens are fully backed by dollars.

This has led to a lot of stablecoin competition in the crypto space, with each new fiat back stablecoin company claiming, that its tokens are backed by more dollars, than its competitors tokens.

## ONE OFE THE BIG ONES - TETHER (USDT)

The three largest stablecoin issuers have all recently revealed these details, which means we can finally assess, which of these stablecoins are legit, and which ones are backed by nothing more than *funny money*.

**USDT** is the largest stablecoin circulating in the crypto market, and is issued by **Tether**.

Tether is based in Hong Kong and is closely affiliated with Bitfinex, a Hong Kong-based cryptocurrency exchange.

Tether was founded in 2014, and its USDT stablecoin was originally built on top of Bitcoin, using the OMNI layer protocol.

Today USDT exists on OMNI, Ethereum, TRON, EOS, Liquid, Algorand, Solana, and even Bitcoin Cash.

Via the simple ledger protocol, about 50% of all the USDT in circulation exists on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token.

Though apparently there have been no new USDT tokens issued on Ethereum since May.


### HOW DOES TETHER EARN?

How Tether makes money off USDT?

The answer is **fees**. 

In addition to a 0.1% cut of all fiat deposits and withdrawals, Tether charges 150 for KYC verification, which is required to mint and redeem USDT and the other stablecoins it offers.

### WHAT BACKS USDT?

Initially, Tether stated that USDT was backed one-to-one by US dollars in a bank.

This changed in March of 2019, when Tether rewrote the collateral clause to include "*other assets and receivables from loans, made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities"*.

Tether keeps track of the assets backing its various stable coins on the transparency page of its website, which is updated every day.

As you can see, there isn't very much detail here.

Nobody really knew, what was backing USDT until mid-May this year, when Tether released a breakdown of its reserves as part of its settlement agreement with the New York Department of Justice. 

According to Tether, the USDT in circulation is backed by the following assets:

- 76% cash cash equivalents, short-term deposits and commercial paper, which is divided into various categories in that orange pie chart. As one can see, it's mostly in commercial paper, with just a sliver in cash.
- 12.5% secured loans, 
- 10% corporate bonds funds and precious metals, and
- 1.5% other assets, including digital tokens, aka *cryptocurrency*.

## SECOND BIG PLAYER - CIRCLE (USDC)

USDC is the second largest stablecoin circulating in the crypto market, and it's issued by Circle.

Circle is based in the United States, specifically Boston Massachusetts.

Circle was founded in 2013 and has raised over 770 million dollars from big names, such as Goldman Sachs, Bitman and Digital Currency Group.

Since that time in October 2018, Circle partnered with Coinbase to form the center consortium, which governs the USDC stablecoin.

USDC was initially issued as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, and this is where most of its circulating supply remains.

USDC can also be found on Algorand, Solana, TRON, Stella, and a few other blockchains.

The center consortium has been pushing to get USDC on as many cryptocurrency blockchains, as possible, and they recently announced plans to deploy on 10 additional cryptochains.

### HOW CIRCLE EARNS?

In contrast to Tether, Circle seems to make most of its money from payments made in USDC?

Something which can now be done via Visa, thanks to the partnership they recently penned.

Circle has 0 fees for bank transfers, and also no fees for exchanging US dollars for USDC and vice versa.

This is one of the many reasons, why USDC has been growing at a faster rate than USDT as of late.

### RAPORT

Another reason relates to the transparency reports around the assets backing USDC, which can be found on the Center Consortium website.

Grant Thornton, one of the largest accounting firms provides attestations of the assets backing USDC on a monthly basis.

Historically, these have not been very detailed and have provided about the same amount of information as Tether does on its transparency page.

However, in late July this year, Circle released a detailed breakdown of exactly which assets make up the dollar amount that's backing USDC.

Why?

The answer is that Circle is preparing to list on the stock exchange in a Spac deal, and they want to be as transparent as possible for regulators and both current and future shareholders.

According to Grant Thornton, the USDC in circulation is backed by the following assets:

- 61% Cash, and Cash Equivalents,
- 13% Tankee Certificates of Deposit or CDs, 
- 12% US Treasuries,
- 9% Commercial Paper,
- 5% Corporate Bonds, and 
- less than 1% in Municipal Bonds.

## THIRD PLAYER - PAXOS (BUSD)

BUSD is the third largest stablecoin circulating in the crypto market, and it is issued by Paxos.

Paxos is also based in the United States, specifically New York.

Paxos was founded in 2012, and has likewise raised hundreds of millions of dollars over the years.

Most of this money came fromlesser known investors, but this list includes payment giants like Paypal.

Fun fact, Paxos actually custodies the cryptocurrencies being bought and sold on Paypal.

BUSD is technically a branded version of Paxos's less popular PAX stablecoin, which went live in 2018.

BUSD is the product of Paxos's partnership with Binance in September 2019, and it exists on Ethereum, the Binance Chain and the Binance Smart Chain.

All the assets which back BUSD are custodied by Paxos.

Like Circle, Paxos does not have any fees for the creation or redemption of its stablecoins.

### HOW DOES PAXOS EARN?

Paxos likely makes most of its money from providing crypto custody and crypto trading services to institutions.

Also like Circle, Paxos publishes monthly attestations of the dollars backing its digital token, and these are done with the help of with the "*nationally top ranking auditing firm*".

Paxos's asset attestations have likewise been very vague until last week, when Paxos pounced on the opportunity to flex, how much better PAX and BUSD are backed compared to USDC.

According to Whitham, 96% of all Paxos stablecoins are currently backed by cash or cash equivalents with 4% being backed by US treasuries.

## WHAT IS IT REALLY BACKED BY?

What are all these assets backing the largest stablecoins, and what makes them good or bad?

### TETHER'S USDT

Starting with the small pie chart, almost everything, that's mentioned there, is basically debt of some kind, in the form of a loan to a public or private institution.

- **Treasury Bills** are short-term government **debt** reverse.

- **Repo Notes** can be stocks, but in this case they're probably **debt**.

- **Cash** is **cash**.

- **Fiduciary Deposits** are **assets** held in another bank on your behalf, and 

- **Commercial Paper** is unsecured short-term corporate **debt** 


In the bigger pie chart, **secured loans** are of course **debt**. 

**Corporate bonds and funds** are again **debt**, though **precious metals** aren't.

And last, but not least, **other investments, including digital currencies**, which is probably **Bitcoin**.

### CIRCLE'S USDC

It's a similar story with Circle's own collateral. 

- **Cash Equivalents** are actually short-term **debt**, and the reason why they're called *Cash Equivalents*, is because they're easy to cash out.
- **Yankee CDs** are loans to foreign banks denominated in US dollars, a.k.a **debt**,
- **US treasuries** are **debt**,
- **Commercial Paper** is risky short-term corporate **debt**,
- **Corporate Bonds** are safer corporate **debt**, and 
- **Municipal Bonds** are local government **debt**.

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/stablecoins/circle-back2.png">
</center>

### PAXOS' BUSD

Finally, we have Paxos's reserves, most of which are, again, some form of public or private debt, and probably include a nice chunk of cash.

<center>
<img src="/images/posts/stablecoins/paxos-back.png">
</center>

## WHY THEY HOLD SO MUCH INTEREST?

Why all these stablecoin companies are holding so much debt?

The answer is **interest**. 

If you're sitting on billions of dollars in cash, and you know that all your customers probably aren't going to come asking for it back at the same time, lending money to private and public institutions is a great way, to earn interest on that cash, even though most of the cash being loaned out by these stablecoin issuers will only earn a few percentage points per year.

That works out to a *massive* amount in dollar terms, when you're dealing with that much capital.

It's also not a big deal so long as the assets you're investing in can be quickly changed back into dollars, at a moment's notice to pay back any customers looking to cash their stable coins out.

## SO WHICH ONE IS THE BEST?

It's important to note, that Tether's account of what's backing USDT should be taken with a grain of salt.

That's because they simply posted a pie chart, without oversight from any accounting or auditing firm.

While Paxos and Circle do provide attestations of their reserves on a monthly basis, is not the same as an audit.

**An attestation is just when a third party verifies the information being shown to them.**

**An audit is when a third party actually goes digging through all the paperwork to see, what's not being shown to them.**

That said, Paxos apparently does get audited from time to time, and this is because it's a trust company regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services.

Although none of these audits seem to be posted on Paxos's website, its status as a trust company means that Paxos can only hold assets, that are safe liquid and insured in their reserves.

## IS PAXOS THE MOST PROMISING?

This is the biggest difference between Paxos and its two contemporaries, and it's also why such a large percentage of Paxos's reserves are made up of cash and cash equivalents.

Even if all their cash equivalents are debts of some kind, they are a form of debt, that can be quickly redeemed for dollars, regardless of market conditions.

This means that people, who hold BUSD or PAX can know for sure that they can cash out, even if the crypto market is collapsing.

The type of debt, that lies at the opposite end of the safety spectrum, is Commercial Paper, whose safety ultimately depends on the company, which issued it.

Almost 50% of Tether's reserves are Commercial Paper, and there is of course no way of knowing, which corporations it came from.

The origin of Circle's Commercial Paper is also unknown, but the bigger issue is that, the other assets it holds are not nearly as liquid as Cash Equivalents.

## IN TIMES OF BLACK SWAN EVENT

This means that in the event, that the financial markets are crashing across the board circle, could be 10-25% short of the dollars it needs for its customers to cash out in a timely manner.

Funnily enough, Tether doesn't have this problem, because its legal disclaimer notes that "*Tether reserves the right to delay the redemption or withdrawal of Tether tokens, if such delay is necessitated by the illiquidity or unavailability, or loss of any reserves held by Tether*".

And that "*Tether reserves the right to redeem Tether tokens by in-kind redemptions of securities and other assets held in the reserves*".

**In other words, Tether doesn't guarantee redemption of USDT for fiat at all.**

## FINAL THOUGHTS

Stablecoins have been contentious cryptocurrencies, and it's easy to see why.

The lack of transparency from the companies, which issue fiat-backed stablecoins, is astounding to say the least, and regulators have reasons to be concerned.

Imagine, what would happen, if Tether, Circle and Paxos invested hundreds of billions of dollars into regular markets with their stablecoin collateral.

If the crypto market crashed and everyone came running to redeem their stablecoins, this would cause an unbelievable amount of cell pressure for whatever assets these stablecoin issuers are holding.

If most of that money happens to be sitting in assets, like home equities, it could potentially crash the housing market, and bring the stock market down with it.

While this might not be a risk today, at the rate that fiat back stablecoins are growing, it will be a risk sooner rather than later.

On the bright side, it's extremely unlikely, that governments will ban fiat-backed stablecoins anytime soon.

They and the corporations, they bow to, need someone to buy all their debt after all.
