## TOKENOMICS
**Tokenomics mean Token Economics.** 

It includes a whole series of metrics relating to cryptocurrency, coin or token, such as *supply*, *allocation*, *distribution*, *emission* and *utility*.

Coins are used to:

- pay fees on their native network,
- transfer value,
- are given as a reward to miners when a new block is mined.

Instead of being used for baseline newtwork activities, like fee payments, tokens often have unique use cases, that are specific to the projects, that made them.

*For example: Decentraland's MANA token which is burned to purchase digital assets on the Decentraland Marketplace.*

## SUPPLY

Dogecoin is one of the biggest cryptocurrencies by market cap, even though the dollar value of each coin is low.

Other crypto, like Yarn.finance's YFI token, have a small supply, and its why one YFI is worth more than one BTC, even though it has 1/4 of the market cap of Dogecoin.

Therefore YFI has more potential to grow compared to Dogecoin.

This is because its easier for a cryptocurrency with a market cap of 1.3 billion to double in value, than a crypto with a market cap of 7.3 billion.

Each crypto's market cap is calculated by multyplying the number of coins or tokens in circulation with the currenct price of that coin or token.

**In circulation** means *wihout the tokens, that hasn't been mined yet or are locked*.

**Fully diluted valuation** - theoretical market cap of the crypto, if every coin or token was in circulation.

## ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION

Cryptocurerncies are created in two ways
- by fair launch,
- bypre-mine a fair launch.

**Fair launch** - a small community of people start collectively mining a coin or token (BTC, Litecoin, Dogecoin). No coin or token accolactions for fair launch cryptos. Allocation is relevant to any crypto that was premined.

**Pre-mine** is when the team behind the project mint some or all of the coins or tokens before opening up the network to the public. A portion of these pre-mined coins or tokens is usually sold prior to the launch of the network to raise the funds needed to build it.

Many of the coins seen today were originally sold as tokens. Specifically ERC20 tokens on ethereum.

**ICO - initial coin offering. Also a good way to promote new tokens.**

Distribution of ETH. The ones in boxes are smart contracts, not actual wallets.

## VESTING AND INFLATION

Applies to pre-mined cryptocurrencies and refers to how the coins or tokens are expected to be allocated over the coming months or years.

It's common for cryptocurrency projects with a pre-mine to lock up a certain portion of their tokens and gradually release them over time. This increases the confidence of regular token holders, that the market won't be flooded by tokens allocated to the team and private investors.

Usually these vesting schedules are pretty logical and take place over many years.

**CAREFUL WITH THE GRAPH AS THE ONE ABOVE!**

Unlocking too many tokens at once or within a short time frame can sink the price action of that token in the short term.

When it comes to inflation, cryptocurrency is either **inflationary** or **deflationary**.


#### INFLACTIONARY TOKENS

If a crypto has too much inflation, it can reduce the value of the coins or tokens already in circulation over time.

Unless the inflation schedule is extremly aggressive, it will have little to no effect on the short-term price potential of a cryptocurrency.

Proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies often have some degree of inflation to incentivize validators and delegators on their networks. 

This normally ranges anywhere between 5-15%.

Crypto like Polkadot adjust their inflation based on staking participation to maintime the security of the network.

Many DeFi tokens also use inflation to reward liquidity providers and yield farmers on their respective protocols.

DeFi tokens often have incredibly aggressive inflation schedules to keep their annual percentage yields.

#### DEFLACTIONARY TOKENS

If the crypto is defiationary the reduction in supply increases the value of that crypto over time.

While this may also not have a big influence in the short term, this deflation is part of why cryptocurrencies like BTC are so valuable.

Although new BTC are mined every 10 mins, Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 milllion and the amount of new BTC being created per block is cut in half roughly every 4 years.

Bitcoin is deflationary because of **accidential loss**.

Everytime some someone forgets their password, it reduces the supply of crypto in circulation.

**This means that crypto with a maximum supply like BTC are deflationary in practice.**

Conversely, some cryptocurrencies intentionally reduce their supply by burning coins or tokens.

For example, the latest upgrade to Ethereum, will burn part of the ETH used to pay for network fees.

Even though Ethereum is tecnically inflationary, if enough people are using this network, the fee burns will be more than the inflation, which would turn ETH into a deflationary asset.

Some belive that this change could propel the price of ETH well past 20k dollars.

Unfortunately to the people staking their ETH on Ethereum 2.0, they probably won't be able to realize those gains even when they come.

## STAKING AND UTILITY

When you stake a cryptocurrency as a validator or a delegator, those coins or tokens are usually locked up for some period of time.

In the case  of Ethereum 2.0 any ETH being stake will not be unlocked until 2022.

At the earliest this means, that if the price of ETH starts to skyrocket, all the ETH being staked is not going to be making it onto any exchanges.

This conveniently restricts the actual circulating supply of ETH, which could enhance the positive price action.

This effect is much bigger for other proof-of-stake crypto like Polkadot, where more than 60% of DOT's supply is being staked. 28 day unlock period.

Cardano have no lock up periods for staked coins. This means that all of that staked ADA could move onto exchanges at a moment's notice and push a parabolic move back down as people take profits.

Besides the restrictive effects on supply staking is also a common utility for many coins and tokens.

**Utility is also referred to as a use case and includes basically anything that drives demand for a cryptocurrency coin or token.**

**BTC's primary utility is as a store of value, like gold.**

The difference is that, BTC is accessible to bascally anyone with an internet connection, whereas gold requires a bit more infrastructure to get your hands on and store.

Given how poorly fiat currencies hold their value these days, there is a lot of demand for an easily accessible store of value like Bitcoin. 

Hence that's why it is the most valuable cryptocurrency on the market.

**Ethereum's primary utility is to pay fees to use the decentralized applications built on it and move any ERC20 tokens around.**

There are hundres of Dapps and thousands of EREC20 tokens, which means a lot of demand for ETH to pay gas fees.

Hence, why it is the second most valuable cryptocurrency on the market.

Market caps of many DeFi tokens like ARVE are almost one-to-one with the total value locked on their protocols.

This makes it easy to spot DeFi crypto that are undervaluated or overvaluated.

## CONCLUSIONS

While crypto tokens may be more profitable investments, they are also riskier to hold because of the regulatory risks they face.

Moreover, token profits are often short-lived, as many cryptocurrency projects with tokens aren't built to last for more than a few years.

Cryptocurrency coins often support larger ecosystems, which include Dapps, crypto tokens, that gives coins a longer shelf life and results in a more gradual increase in value as their ecosystem grow.

This growth in value isn't always obvious, if you're working off of te price alone.

Small circulating supplies can also threaten that value in near or distant future, if any of there idle coins or tokens start to move onto the market.

Usually its worth to value crypto based on their fully diluted market caps. This makes it easy to spot, when a cryto is overvaluated or undervaluated, regardless of its price tag.
